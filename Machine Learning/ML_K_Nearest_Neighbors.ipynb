It works by finding the nearest $K$ neighbors of an observation and using those neighboring points to make a prediction. KNN naturally handles multiclassification problems.

For classification, the predicted label is the class with the plurality, i.e., which class is most represented among the neighbors.\n",

    "With machine learning models, it is important to understand how altering hyperparameters affects the bias-variance tradeoff. For KNN, how does increasing the number of neighbors affect the bias and variance error? One good way to answer these types of questions is to consider the extreme cases. Let's first consider the case where we only have one neighbor. With one neighbor, the predicted value will be highly variable on the training data, running the risk of adapting to the idiosyncrasies of data set. You can imagine how the predicted value will vary widely depending on the data set we use to train the model because we rely on one point to make a prediction. Consider the other extreme, were the number of neighbors is equal to the training set. If we use the entire training data to make a prediction, we will always predict the same value, regardless where our test observation is located. For regression, we always predict the mean label value of the training data. For classification, we predict the modal class. Since our model at this extreme does not take into consideration the feature values of the observation we want to make prediction, it is simple model with high bias error. For the iris data set, let's determine the right number of neighbors."
