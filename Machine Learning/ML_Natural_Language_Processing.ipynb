    "Natural language processing (NLP) is the field devoted to methods and algorithms for processing human (natural) languages for computers. NLP is a vast discipline that is actively being researched. For this notebook, we will be concerned with NLP tools and techniques we can use for machine learning applications. Some examples of machine learning applications using NLP include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and language translation. In NLP, the following terms have specific meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: The body/collection of text being investigated.\n",
    "* **Document**: The unit of analysis, what is considered a single observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of corpora include a collection of reviews and tweets, the text of the _Iliad_, and Wikipedia articles. Documents can be whatever you decided, it is what your model will consider an observation. For the example when the corpus is a collection of reviews or tweets, it is logical to make the document a single review or tweet. For the example of the text of the _Iliad_, we can set the document size to a sentence or a paragraph. The choice of document size will be influenced by the size of our corpus. If it is large, it may make sense to call each paragraph a document. As is usually the case, some design choices that need to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will build a classifier to discern homonyms, words that are spelled the same but that have different meanings. The exact use case we will explore is to discern if the word \"python\" refers to the programming language or the animal."

    "Machine learning models needs to ingest data in a structured form, a matrix where the rows represents observations and the columns are features/attributes. When working with text data, we need a method to convert this unstructured data into a form that the machine learning model can work with. Let's consider our motivating example to create a classifier to discern the usage of \"python\" in a document. We understand that documents referring to the programming language will use words such as \"integer\", \"byte\", and \"error\" at higher frequency than documents that refer to python the animal. The reverse is true for words such as \"bite\", \"snake\", and \"pet\". One technique to _transform_ text data into a matrix is to count the number of appearances of each word in each document. This technique is called the **bag of words** model. The model gets its name because each document is viewed as a bag holding all the words, disregarding word order, context, and grammar. After applying the bag of words model to a corpus, the resulting matrix will exhibit patterns that a machine learning model can exploit.

We need to use a weighting scheme that considers the aforementioned attributes. The term frequency-inverse document frequency, **tf-idf** for short, is a popular weighting scheme to improve the simple count based data from the bag of words model. It is the product of two values, the term frequency and the inverse document frequency. There are several variants but the most popular is defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Term Frequency:**\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{tf}(t, d) = \\frac{\\mathrm{counts}(t, d)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{t \\in d} \\mathrm{counts}(t, d)^2}}, $$\n",
    "    where $\\mathrm{counts}(t, d)$ is the raw count of term $t$ in document $d$ and $t \\in d$ are the terms in document $d$. The normalization results in a vector of unit length.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inverse Document Frequency:**\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{idf}(t, D) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{number of documents in corpus } D}{1 + \\text{number of documents with term } t}\\right). $$\n",
    "    Every counted term $t$ in the corpus will have its own idf weight. The $1+$ in the denominator is to ensure no division by zero if a term does not appear in the corpus. The idf weight is simply the log of the inverse of a term's document frequency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "With both $\\mathrm{tf}(t, d)$ and $\\mathrm{idf}(t, D)$ calculated, the tf-idf weight is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{tfidf}(t, d, D) = \\mathrm{tf}(t, d) \\mathrm{idf}(t, D).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the idf weighting, words that are very common throughout the documents get weighted down. The reverse is true; the count of rare words get weighted up. With the tf-idf weighting scheme, a machine learning model will have an easier time to learn patterns to properly predict labels."

    "There are two ways to apply the tf-idf weighting in `scikit-learn`, differing in what input they work on. `TfidfVectorizer` works on an array of documents (e.g., list of sentences) while the `TfidfTransformer` works on a count matrix, like the outputs of `HashingVectorizer` and `CountVectorizer`. `TfidfVectorizer` encapsulates the `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer` into one class. Since we have already calculated the word counts, we will demonstrate the `TfidfTransformer`."

The same applies to other words like \"run\", \"runs\", \"ran\", and \"running\", they all represent the same meaning. **Stemming** is the process of reducing a word to its stem. Note, the stemming process is not 100% effective and sometimes the resulting stem is not an actual word. For example, the popular Porter stemming algorithm applied to \"argues\" and \"arguing\" returns `\"argu\"`.\n",

Further, the resulting lemma is an actual word. spaCy does not have a stemming algorithm but does offer lemmatization. Each word analyzed by spaCy has the attribute `lemma_` which returns the lemma of the word."

However, it may be useful to count a sequence of words such as \"natural environment\" and \"virtual environment\". Counting these **bigrams** for our word usage analyzer may boost performance. More generally, an n-gram refers to the n sequence of words. In `scikit-learn`, n-grams can be included by setting `ngram_range=(min_n, max_n)` for the vectorizer, where `min_n` and `max_n` are the lower and upper bound of the range of n-grams to include. For example, `ngram_range=(1, 2)` will include words and bigrams while `ngram_range=(2, 2)` will only count bigrams. Let's see what are the most frequent bigrams in our corpus."

If the vectors are perfectly aligned, they point in the same direction, the angle they form is 0 and the similarity score is 1.

You can think of a naive Bayes classifier working by determining what class should a document be assigned based upon the frequencies of words in the different classes in the training set. Naive Bayes is often used as benchmark model for NLP as it is quick to train. More about the model in general can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) and details of the `scikit-learn` implementation is found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html).
