    "Decision trees are a general class of machine learning models that are used for both classification and regression. They have even been adapted for the use of outlier detection. The trained models resemble a tree, complete with branches and nodes. The model is essentially a series of questions with yes or no answers, where the resulting tree structure contains all the combination of responses.\n",

    "Tree based models are popular because they mimic human decision making process, work well for a large class of problems, naturally handle multiclassification, and handle a mix of categorical and numerical data. They are also easy to understand and explain. The transparency of a model is often called its *explicability*. Models with low explicability are often referred to as \"black boxes\" and are difficult to derive insight over the process they are modeling.\n",

In other words, the additional trees will be very different from the current trees simply because the forest is small. The increase in tree diversity drives predictive power. As the forest grows, newer trees will not be significantly different from the current pool of trees as bootstrapping is no longer producing substantially diverse training sets to create very different looking trees."

    "An extremely randomized trees is a variation of the random forest model that injects additional randomness. As with a random forest, a random subset of the features are selected to determine which one to use for a node split. However, instead of considering the optimal split point _for each_ selected feature, a candidate for the split for each feature is chosen at _random_. From these randomly chosen values, the best is chosen to perform the split. The extra randomness serves two folds: it helps reduce the model's variance and leads to faster training times. In `scikit-learn`, the extremely randomized tree model is provided by `ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and `ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`.\n",
