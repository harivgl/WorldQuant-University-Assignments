    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this miniproject is to gain experience with natural language processing and how to use text data to train a machine learning model to make predictions. For the miniproject, we will be working with product review text from Amazon. The reviews are for only products in the \"Electronics\" category. The objective is to train a model to predict the rating, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the questions, you will be asked to submit the `predict` method of your trained model to the grader. The grader will use the passed `predict` method to evaluate how your model performs on a test set with respect to a reference model. The grader uses the [R<sup>2</sup>-score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#r2-score) for model evaluation. If your model performs better than the reference solution, then you can score higher than 1.0. For the last question, you will submit the result of an analysis and your passed answer will be compared directly to the reference solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading and loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is available on Amazon S3 and comes as a compressed file where each line is a JSON object. To load the data set, we will need to use the `gzip` library to open the file and decode each JSON into a Python dictionary. In the end, we have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an observation."

I could not be happier.Since it's USB, I can plug it in with the computer already on and expect it to work automatically.  Since it's optical (the new kind, not to be confused with the old Sun optical mice that required a special checkered mouse pad) it works on most surfaces, including my pant legs, my couch, and random tables that I put my laptop down on.  It's also light and durable, features that help with portability.The wheel is surprisingly useful.  In addition to scrolling, it controls zoom and pan in programs like Autocad and 3D Studio Max.  I can no longer bear using either of these programs without it.One complaint - the software included with the Internet navigation features is useless.  Don't bother installing it if you have a newer Windows version that automatically supports wheel mice.  Just plug it in and use it - it's that easy.\",\n",

Having to keep the full sized keyboard shifted way to the right in order to center the keys I used with the monitor I viewed and then having to reach way over to mouse always bothered me.  This keyboard has solved the problem.  It looks great and the white letters and numbers are easier to read than those on my laptop keys so that is very helpful.  You really don't know how much stress you are putting on your body by having to reach past that (for many of us) useless numeric keypad until you get rid of it and feel the difference.  My arm is allowed to stay closer to the rest of me and it feels great.  There are a few differences between the layout of this keyboard and a full-sized one so expect a period of adjustment but the differences are very few so it has been an easy transition.  I also bought the Logitech V200 cordless mouse and the combination of the new smaller keyboard and the cordless mouse has made my life at the computer even more enjoyable that it was before.\",\n",

Opps, same thing, the speaker played nicely for 30 seconds and then went dead (the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played). I emailed Amazon.com and wanted to role the dice and give it a 3rd try. Amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one. They refunded all my money also gave me a $10 credit in my account for the hassle. I was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect, the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue. Should I give the speaker another try? I really did like the product if it would only work. I've searched the customer reviews and this problem is NOT isolated to me.  Well, if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after 30 seconds. It seemed like a solid product but at the low price of $32.00, I'm not surprised it failed to work. Please leave feedback as I would like to order anothrer myself, but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy Amazon tries to make it.  Also, I wanted to mention that it was very generous of Amazon to give me a $10 credit for my troubles with the speaker... Amazon.com is a very reputable company I recommend them strongly and I will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future.  Best of luck with this one.\",\n",

They keep the sound to myself and block out external sounds such as songs in the gym well enough. When they fold they fit easily enough into my extercise pant pockets for easy portability. They appear to be made with high quality and I expect them to hold up for some time.  I'm am not an audio expert, but I'm more than satisfied with the sound these headphones produce.

       "  'reviewText': \"So after reading the other reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try these speakers out. I wasn't looking to have my mind blown but I was looking forward to something better than the 20 year old speakers that were completely dried up in my existing car.And that's exactly what I got...Better speakers than what I had. For the money, you honestly can't complain but these speakers are not ideal for any type of LOUD music. The mid-level frequencies get CRUSHED under any substantial load. Base response is practically zilch but when combined with a subwoofer, they are actually not that bad.I have no idea what Pyle does to rate their speakers but ... 200watts is absolutely a farce. The magnet on each speaker is TINY. The 20 year old Pioneers that came with my car had way bigger magnets. Not that magnets are the whole story but sheesh. When I opened these new out of the box, I was starting to worry at the size of the magnet.In the end, these speakers are capable of being loud when coupled with an amp, but don't expect too much tonal clarity - especially in the mid range. You would think a 3-way speaker would have a decent mid but these do not. Everything gets crushed and requires you to EQ the center band. If you have a 5 band EQ, you might get away with it but anything else will be limited with regards to the audio output.When installing these in the front of my car (under the dash), the three way design makes them stick out ... ALOT. So keep that in mind if you are installing these inside a dash. Diameter wise, they were OK but I had to really wedge the plastic bits of my dash and grille in order to fit the speakers and even then they are bulging. Just keep that in mind...So three stars for these guys because they do what you want for the money but in the long run, you will be throwing them out after some use. They got me out of an audio bind in the car as well as a financial bind with the wife but honestly, you are better off saving up another $40 and dropping the money on some way better speakers.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"As a Minox fan and owner since 1969 and gadget lover, I was eager to see how this much-touted little gem worked.  I first did a lot of research reading data and reviews.  BOTTOM LINE PREPURCHASE INFO:  No other beginners camera even comes close to the quality of photograph and accompanying software.  Having bought two fancy digital cameras for family and friends and a Panasonic Palmcorder with good digital camera inside it, I am well aware of imaging software. ...P>PERFORMANCE:  The little camera performed as expected.  Operation was simple with two buttons and good menu and LCD menu indicator, photos reasonably sharp given the tiny size, and the accompanaying software superbly usable.  It even came with a Duracell AAA battery, a detail no other review noted, but to me connoting a note of quality and not tyring to cheap out every which way.  As a webcam, I looked at the images produced, and they were typically sub-mediocre but also in line with webcams of this price.  Indoor shots are a bit fuzzy, but my son took a great panorama shot in a seminar room of me giving a seminar, which I easily stitched into a broad panorama with the included software.  By the way, one review I read was dead wrong:  The delayed beep does not indicate when the photo exposure starts; rather, the delayed beep indicates when the photo exposure stops, which inside in dim light is a couple seconds.TWO FLAWS:  First, I almost sent the camera back, because the image gets a bit blurred around all the edges.  Then I looked up photos posted on the British Amazon site and elsewhere, and they were the same way.  This I can live with.  Second and more serious, the battery drains disturbingly rapidly when you're storing a lot of pictures. For two weeks I had no trouble, but last weekend I went on a trip, took perhaps 30 pictures, and the battery drained in less than two days, leaving me with three photos only.  This problem has been noted in other reviews, but I can live with it also.  However, if you take a lot of photos, download soon.  I have yet to experiment systematically with it, but I changed the battery quickly with those three pictures, and they were still there after changing the battery, whereas the instructions say you will lose pictures when you change batteries.  There may be some mechanism that allows you a socond to change batteries and not lose your photos....P>CONCLUSION:  The SiPix Blink is the first camera ever that allows the general public to experience what (subminiature camera) Minox owners have enjoyed for decades:  A camera you can and ACTUALLY WILL take anywhere that takes decent pictures.  SiPix is currently a price performance breakthrough, throughly fun, and a great affordable way to get into digital.  Not bad for insurance purposes too.  As for me, I'll use mine a lot, but I'll still carry my Minox B, the last of the Minox cameras needing no batteries.Jim\",\n",

The $15.00 filter took the hit, Also, for you adding to your lenses. If you are considering the Canon backback, it is wonderful, and not so wonderful. To me the camera body is not padded enough and of course it has a huge Canon label on the outside.  This has cost me to have my car windows broken into, the Canon name.

After trying a variety of speaker phones and handsets, she determined that she obtained the best combination of comfort and clarity from headsets.

       "  'reviewText': \"This review should probably apply to all sound isolation earphones.  That is, phones that require you to insert them into your ear canal, much (very much) like ear plugs.First off, a word about fit.  The E2Cs come with seven types of buds to provide the best fit to your ears.  It is absolutely necessary to find the right fit.  Apparently I have very narrow ear canals, since the only ones that fit were the smallest buds, and I still have to work to get them in.  The main reason I wanted to try these headphones is because normal ear bud phones simply do not fit my ears - the slightest head shake and they fall out.  The E2Cs provide a decent fit.  I could not go jogging with these (wouldn't want to - see below), but normal walking around is fine.  The first few days were sort of uncomfortable, after a while my ears would ache a bit.  But you DO get used to it.  Give it at least a week before you decide if these are for you.Important!  Buy from the Shure Website.  It will link you back to Amazon.  The reason for this is to make sure you get Shure's 30-day money back guarantee.  These phones are not for everyone and you can't try them out before you buy.  Even if you find a local store, it is unlikely that they will open the package and let you stick them into your ear canal to test them.  And some stores will not accept returns on ear bud head phones.  Wherever you buy them, ask about their return policy first.Now to the sound.  These little guys sound great.  Clear and accurate, I am hearing things in the music that I didn't know was there.  They completely isolate what you are hearing, blocking off 95% of external sound.  Whether you are listening to hard rock, or something acoustic, you can be in a subway and it's like you are in a movie with a soundtrack - no noise but what you are listening to.  Quite simply, this type of headphone gives you much better sound than any other portable system.It is these earphones greatest strength that is their greatest limitation.  Imagine going through life with ear plugs and you may get my point.  Sometimes it is important to hear stuff and with these all you hear is the music.  Things you can't do with sound isolation ear bud phones:1. Jog - too dangerous.  Unless you are in a deserted area, it is not a good idea to totally isolate yourself.  Even hiking can be chancy.2. Walk in crowded areas.  After just a week, I lost count the number of times I have bumped into people or almost got run over.  You don't realize how much you unconsciously rely on you hearing to get through your day until you lose it.3. Eat.  Try eating with a set of those foam ear plugs in your ears.  Every body movement (especially chewing) is magnified.  It just feels weird.  This applies to running/exercise as well - the sound of your feet striking the ground is deafening.4. Have any kind of conversation.  You can't hear them, and you find yourself shouting.  Can't do it.Try spending a day wearing ear plugs and you should get an idea of the limitations.What you can do is sit in a train/plane/car (as passenger, duh) and ignore everything else.  I am using on the DC metro and it is great.  No stress with crowds, just find a seat, close your eyes and try not to miss your stop.  If you have a job that lets you tune out your co-workers, the phone and any fire alarms, these are great as well.I have not yet decided if I am going to keep these.  For around $100, they are very limited in their use.  They simply cannot be your only set of head phones since you WILL need another set when in situations requiring at least some hearing.  But the sound can't be beat by any basic ear bud or behind the head ear phones out there.  If you are into the sound, get them and give them a good two week trial to see if they work for you.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"My husband and I kept debating and debating about whether to purchase a digital camera. We have a 35mm Canon EOS Rebel that takes gorgeous pictures. But, we knew if we got a digital camera, we'd end up using our wonderful camera a lot less. Fortunately, his dad killed our endless debate by purchasing this Fuji for us for Christmas.I have to say, I like it a lot. There are some things that could be better, but for a 4 MP point-and-shoot, especially at this price, it's great. It's small enough to fit in a coat pocket (definitely not true of our big Canon), and takes very clear pictures. We did upgrade the xD card immediately, for a lot more memory. The flash, as another reviewer mentioned, really works without washing out the scene - as you view the picture before snapping, it looks way too dark, but once it's taken, it is wonderful.The cons, though, are also there - though I don't know that they are any worse than any other digital camera. The amazon review mentions speed. I find that you do have to wait quite a while between photos if you use the flash - definitely longer than .62 seconds, anyway. This is kind of annoying - we have twin 2 year olds, and they don't stand still very long. And, this thing eats batteries. We don't have rechargeable ones, but will definitely be investing in those soon. In some ways, it's nice that it takes AA's - you can certainly buy them quickly most anywhere, rather than having to go home and charge it up - but you'd better have plenty around.The 3X zoom just doesn't seem to be enough to me (probably spoiled by our digital camcorder, as well as the Canon), and it is very hard to manipulate quickly. The menus, as others have mentioned, are not terribly intuitive, and they could have added a couple of extra navigation buttons to make it more user-friendly.However, overall, it's a good little camera. I was set up on the computer with it within a half hour (we don't have the cradle) and the Fuji software is nice, too. I'm sure using it a lot, which is a good sign!\",\n",

(2) The little storage case in the picture appears promising, but in reality is flimsy and cheap.  (3) If you are not careful, you will lose the earpads (they tend to come off if you are not very careful), and will have to order new pads from Sony at the ridiculous cost of about $10.00 each (with shipping).  (4) Finally, after a while the volume of my pair decreased to about half the original, making them useless in a noisy environment (for example, an airplane).Altogether: not a hot buy!Amazon's shipping strategy is amazing.  If you drop a small envelope (which is all that this product requires) in the good ol' USPS mailbox in NV (origin), it gets to VA (destination) in about 4 days.  Amazon shipped it via a bizarre combination route that took 9 days to arrive.  The small merchants do it better: your stuff arrives in 3-4 days; Amazon, in comparison, appears to take forever.\",\n",

I needed an affordable solution with decent features and good quality digital photos and the Canon A75 3.2MP did the job for over 2 years, until someone stole the camera from my bag!This camera traveled with me through Europe for 2 months, China for 1 month and was always carried on me, in my sack or in my car almost all the time without a case every single day for 2 years.  It was thrown around in my sack or backpack and it did not fall apart or break, though it did show some cosmetic wear. I was impressed that it never mechanically broke and the camera worked flawlessly even after all the miles I put on it.I must have taken well over a 1000 pictures with the camera and the flash never dimmed but I did go through batteries much quicker at high quality settings. But at mid level (1024x768) and low res settings, the camera was very battery efficient.I was impressed by the quality of the pictures, very clean and very nice high quality images for the most part. I was also impressed with the high ISO sensitivity for indoor pics.  I took a bunch of indoor sports picks without a flash at high shutter speed with ISO mode and they turned out very well for a point and shoot camera. I was impressed for a cheap camera. At the time, the A75 3.1MP camera was great and I will miss it.  I'm sure the person who stole this camera from me is getting great use from it too.\",\n",

Original expectation for delivery was end of April which then became mid-May, end of May and now -- October 6th!?!?  I know these are hot items, but 7 months lead time is absurd.  If they don't have them (and aren't getting them) it would seem that they should stop taking orders.  It is now July 8th so who knows, as we get closer to October they may push the date back yet again to December or January - so much for planning ahead to have one for my wife's birthday which was mid-May, who would have guessed that eight weeks wouldn't have been enough back then.  Note that I HAVE NOT made any changes to my order which would impact a change in expected delivery date.  A few weeks ago they did make the minor consolation of upgrading me to 2-day shipping (from super saver) but to be honest, if I'm waiting 6-8 months, do I care about another 2-3 days of delivery time?Hopefully I can update this review when (or should I say if) I get the iPod mini.------Update:  I received the iPod mini on July 21st - only four months from order to delivery, definitely the slowest experience I've ever had with Amazon.  The iPod itself is great, good OS, clear screen - battery life is a bit weak - around 3-4 hours - but I suppose what else do you expect in such a small package.  The included iTunes software is horrific, nowhere near as intuitive as musicmatch jukebox which came with our first generation iPod.  All in all, a great device - just watch out for Amazon taking orders that they may not be able to fulfill!\",\n",

What is surprising is the bass.Regrettably, the bass is the only interesting thing about the sound, since midrange and treble are seriously lack-lustre. In Sony's defense, these are also the most comfortable earbud-style phones I've ever used.Don't expect the mid-size rubber pads that come already installed to fit perfectly - one of the things that surprised me was that my left ear needed the larger pad to effect a good seal from outside sounds, and to secure the bass response.Using these for watching a DVD movie (The Fifth Element) on my laptop was a reasonably pleasant experience  - it seems that the excess bass doesn't really mess up movie sound too much.If you thinking of using these for classical or baroque music, forget it - the lack of midrange and treble is insanely irritating.In fact, I'm keeping them only because they are very comfortable and small enough to pack in my laptop bag, and I have decided that the bass problem is one I can live with for now.iPod users might find that using the &quot;Treble Booster&quot; equalizer setting helps to compensate for the overbearing bass that these generate. If you're using them with a computer for playing music, you're going to need to play with equalizer settings to get a more even sound.It's important to note that unlike most other ear-bud phones, these do significantly reduce ambient sounds (with no sound signal applied, they work rather well as ear-plugs), so I don't think you should use them in situations where hearing impairment can endanger you.\",\n",

Just peel off the backing, and they will stick. I did not put them on my unit. I have mine sitting on carpet, and it leans slightly, so I might go ahead on put the feet on so it can have a stable footing on the carpet.I gave this tower four stars, because the wood balls needed to be drilled out.

It connects to your TV just like a VCR, but like an ultra cheap VCR the remote control and on screen menus are very poorly implemented.Even with fresh batteries you need to be close to the recorder to get it to respond to the remote. Sometimes buttons must be pushed again and again. The remote contains a lot of buttons, but Go Video skimped on size so the buttons are small and close together.On screen menus are blurry and use small print so you need to be quite close to the screen. You'll be near the screen anyway given the remote's very limited range.The video quality appeared to be worse than the VCR I replaced it with. There was none of the sharpness that you'd expect from a DVD even with a store bought DVD movie.Timed recordings went well.The last straw for me was the media. The manual states that it will work with all DVD+R and DVD+RW media that adhere to the standards, blah blah blah. I bought HP DVD+R disks and the unit responded with an error.This unit is priced relatively low for a home DVD recorder, but if this is the best they can do for the price, skip it until they get the bugs out and bring the quality up.\",\n",

If I had known in advance I could have ordered everything I needed and saved time and an additional $8 shipping fee.

And since larger lenses need more power to focus, and Image Stabilization drains the batteries more quickly, two batteries can come in handy.  Most likely you'll have power for at least a full day of heavy shooting.  Unfortunately, though the EOS-10D itself can take BP-512 batteries, this grip cannot - BP-511/511as or similarly-shaped batteries only.  It can use different batteries in combination, even with different power ratings; it will first use the higher-charged battery, then drain them both equally.  I use a Power 2000 1500mAh/7.4v together with my old BP-511 1100mAh/7.4v.It comes with a little slot in the side of the shaft that can hold the camera's battery cover (which must be removed) or an extra CF card.  Handy.  And you get extra control buttons on the grip for taking pictures in a vertical orientation, and a switch to disable them.The price is excessive, though.  If it were priced similarly to the Rebel's grip, I'd give this five stars easily.  At US$200, it's a much tougher call - it should still go on your wish lists, but at a much lower priority, depending on your purposes and equipment.\",\n",

The Linksys worked perfectly and I nearly bought the Linksys wireless but the price was right on this unit and I took a gamble.  I am glad that I did.In two weeks of use I have only had to reset the router once and I am not even sure that this was the routers fault.  It may have been my DSL modems fault.  One day after I bought the unit I had a hardware failure on the D-Link wireless LAN card.  In the process of troubleshooting the problem I called SMC support number.  The number is toll free and the help was quick, no waiting on hold.  The tech support person was courteous, knowledgeable and didn't seem in a rush to get me off the phone.  I was very impressed.  This was a far cry from the support I have gotten from D-Link and Linksys.  Both of these companies make decent hardware but support is not there strong point and Linksys has virtually no documentation or online support.I have upgraded the firmware once and it was trouble free.  The web based control panel is comprehensive and easy to use.  If anything the control panel is even more useful and flexible then the comparable Linksys router.  The unit itself is small and attractive.  The only negative I have is that the lights on the front of the router are not clearly viewable except when looked at head on.The range on this unit is great.  I live in a townhouse that has 1200 square feet upstairs and 1200 square feet downstairs.  The router is in the northwest corner of the downstairs and I use the wireless units most commonly in the southeast corner of the upstairs.  The transfer rate is a consistent 11 mbs even when I step outside.Over all an excellent router.  I have run it with both the Linksys and D-Link cards and both work fine.  The D-Link card comes with better monitoring software but the Linksys card seems to give me greater range and consistency.  A definite buy recommendation on my part.\",\n",

E-mail me if you want the secret.Otherwise this is an excellent as usual product from Linksys at a great price.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I read most of the reviews before buying the GS108. The only reviews that worried me were those that complained about the power supply dying in less than 3 years. I have been using NetGear for years & years without a hitch so I went ahead and ordered it anyway. It arrived today, 3/8/2012, and it took all of 1 minute to plug it in & move a couple of RJ-45 connectors (cat5) from my FWAG114 and connect the FWAG114 to the GS108 (cat6).Plug'n'Play, what can I say... but then, it's just a switch so I wouldn't expect anything else and it flat out screams. Remote drives respond as fast as a local drive.As for the power supply, I'll try to find this review & update it later if I have a problem.As for some of the other non-5 star reviews that I wasted my time reading...One guy complained that the lights were too bright (he kept the GS108 in his bedroom). I just wonder what kind of DH goes to sleep with an 8 port Gbit switch in his bedroom. He needs to find a girl friend.Others complained that the RJ-45 connectors were in the front of the unit. Well, duuuh, didn't you look at the picture of the unit before you bought it? Besides, pro grade devices normally have the connectors in the front of the unit. I wish mine were in the back of the unit too like my FWAG114 but I knew what I was buying before I bought it... I looked at the picture. I also spent about 35 years in IT so I was accustomed to seeing the wires in the front of the device.Others said the unit ran hot. Mine is much cooler than my FWAG114 and also much cooler than my AT&T; 3801HGV (which is a 2Wire/Pace DSL/wireless device) and I have it sandwiched in a stack above the FWAG114 & below a USR265633A external USB fax/modem.In closing, if you're considering buying this unit, don't hesitate, just buy it and ignore most of the trivial dribble that gets posted by inexperienced wannabe reviewers... and then keep your fingers crossed that the power supply holds up (which I'm not worried about because I'll want to replace it with a 10Gbit wireless device when they're available/affordable).12/28/2012:It's still going strong and has never burped.\",\n",

We had our Mini with us during a recent trip to Mexico, and it proved itself with wonderful sound quality, an admirable battery life, and great options. It was a great asset to have during a cumulative 10-12 hours of travel time.The mini itself is easy to navigate and understand. She essentially told me how to work it, and the ease in which I have been able to use it has been wonderful. At first, I didn't think much of the 4GB amount of space, but it's been great for me as a person who never transports graphic or movie files.I found the headphones they provided to be more than acceptable and the sound quality I've experienced has been great. At this point, I normally use my Mini while at a desk (while working) and (wonderfully) the mini never gets in the way of any of the work that I have to do. Even better, the mini isn't any sort of hindrance to my coworkers. If I were to ever work in the dark, I know that the beautiful blue hue of a lighted screen would work to light my way (used it on the plane).My only discrepancies are minor - the Mini is seemingly easy to scratch. I looked at mine yesterday and noticed a few gashes in it whose origin I know not. Further, any sort of accessory for the device seems to be kind of pricey after you spend $250 on it.The bottom line: This is a great toy to have, albeit expensive. Tons of options and features make for a wonderfully diverse product. Works as a well-received gift or a smart personal purchase. Don't be rough with it, travel a lot with it, and enjoy.\",\n",

With my setup I have room for a re-purposed Technics 100W receiver, but no good place for speakers, which really have to fit up on the windowsill.  My little Polk Audio bookshelfs -- an even better value -- just don't fit.  So I went looking for something smaller, but still high quality, for under $75.  Well, there ain't much.  This was about it. Fortunately, it's working out very well. Smooth, full sound.  Decent bass.  Really better than I'd expected for the size.  It's an acoustic suspension design (not ported), so it's not particularly efficient.  I'd suggest 50W per channel if you want solid bass.

But be warned -- this camera has a few significant (to me, anyway) limitations.  First, it's basically only good as a snapshot camera in fairly bright light.  It simply can't focus worth a darn unless there's a lot of light on the subject.  This is particularly troublesome because you can't manually focus.  Second, if you use reading glasses (as this 43-year-old reviewer does), then keep 'em around -- you need to decipher small icons on the small LCD to control the camera.  (Better keep the manual handy too.  Hmmm, those reading glasses and manual make the camera a big less portable.)  Third, if you ever want to take closeups, then you've got to use the macro zoom function -- but after hours of trying, for the life of me I can't make it work worth a darn. That said, the camera IS quite nice for daylight shots.  I'd be inclined to buy the underwater housing for it, but underwater shots are by their nature low-light.  The battery charger is very cool -- the battery slips into a cartridge which plugs into the wall.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have well over 1000 CDs.  For a long time, I considered the bookshelves and bookshelves of space that the collection required a tribute to my musical taste and experiences over the years.  Indeed, the jewel cases just seemed to be an easy way to observe the entire collection and rapidly select the CD that I felt like listening to at the moment.Recently, a friend was over at my apartment and commented that the collection just looked ridiculously unwieldy.  She had made the converstion to the CD wallet years ago and was never going back to the space cluster that jewel cases required.On her recommendation, I ordered the Case Logic 264 CD Wallet (she said that anything larger would be a bit heavy to move around with ease despite the fact that I had so many CDs).  Of course, I should say that I ordered 7 of the cases so as to accomdate the large selection.The only comment that appropriately conveys my sentiment is: WOW!  This is great.  Here's why:1. Shelves and shelves of CD shelving have been cleared/removed and converted into 7 (actually about 6.5) CD wallets.  It's unbelievable how great this feels in a New York City apartment.  It has opened up a bunch of space.2. The Case Logic wallet is extremely well constructed.  Having used a smaller version for the car, I somewhat know what to expect.  THe backing of each insert is soft to ensure that CDs aren't scratched and the plastic that holds the CD in place is nice and secure.  Though some have complained about the plastic binder not being able to open midway/midbook in order to easily reorder pages, it seems a LOT more secure than metal ring binders would be in the long term.3. I opted for the 2 CDs per side rather than the 4 that is potential.  Instead, I put the album liner notes next to each CD.  Though this essentially cuts down by 1/2 the number of CDs each book can hold, it seems more pleasing to the eye and disks are much more easily accessible than having to root around behind liner notes to retrieve disk.  Moreover, the fit seemed much too tight with 4 disks and liner notes per side.  Last, trying to get the CDs out of the sleeves when stored 4 to a side with liner notes was a bit hard and I worried about scratching the CD (some of which are long out of print and prized).4. The koskin case is very nice.  Even though I store the wallets in a cabinet now, I imagine you could leave these on a bookshelf and they would not look like too much of an eyesore.5. Access to the CDs is very easy.  Because the sleeves can be reordered, I stuck with an alphabetic listing for rapid access....sometimes one just has to hear THAT song, right?Basically, this product is a delight.  I know it sounds crazy and a bit overdone, but I legimately freed up tons of space and my concerns over the practicality of these CD wallets has been allayed.  Funny, I actually will need to get an 8th in just a little while.....but it's easier than building another bookshelf.Final rating?  A FIVE (5).\",\n",

I was concerned about the casing not being as durable as the ones on the S110, and wasn't sure why they went differently with the S400, but the brushed finish just makes it look that way. The rounded corners actually make it nicer to sit in your pocket. The flash is more powerful, just everything.

The Sennheiser blew away both ear buds and sounded much better than the Philips. Then I plugged the Sennheiser into my high end computer, iAudio and iPod. The sound quality from my computer and iPod were above average. My iAudo X5 sounded the best by far. Of course, I contribute the better sound quality of the iAudio because of the 4 sound settings and EQ. I can get as much or little bass and treble as I prefer. I did find that you have to up the volume to about 20 percent or more to get better sound quality.I prefer the open ear design because I have to be able to hear people around me and listen for the phone.Some annoyances are the 2 cords coming from the ear pieces sometimes brush against my cheek and drive me crazy. One cord coming from just one side would have been much better. And the phones fit a little too tight and become uncomfortable after a short time.However, the Sennheiser PX 100 is still a good choice for the price.

I want this machine to last longer, so I decided to invest in a laptop cooler. Word of mouth is that this Antec is the best for your money if you have a modest budget to work with.I've been using it for about a month now and I'm impressed with it. Setting it up was as easy as plugging it into a free usb port and then plunking the laptop on top of it. It has two fan speeds; I use the higher speed when I'm logging into my alternative OS and the regular speed for normal computing. My laptop stays nice and cool. The cooler comes with optional rubber buttons that you can use to ensure that the laptop doesn't slide around on top of the device. Even if you forgo the buttons, using this device will change the physical profile of your rig a bit, so if you've already got your desk or stand situated for ideal height, expect to adjust it after setting up the cooler. There is a glowing blue light that comes on to let you know the cooler is on and running. If it bugs you, you can easily cover it with a piece of tape.Bottom line: if you can snap this up at the sale price, do it. It's as good as you've heard.\",\n",

Battery life. This uses a AA; the digital uses a AAA, and the difference in battery life is dramatic. The battery life is extraordinary with this analog radio.2. Tuning. It's easier with the digital radio's five preset buttons--if what you want is one of those preset stations. However, the digital radio doesn't have auto-search, so finding stations not on the presets is even more laborious than it is with the analog radio.3. Reception. Seems good, though the analog radio often adds a bit more of the sounds radios add to the station signal when it's not spot-on. Little squeaks and squawks.4. Size. The analog radio is definitely bigger, but it still fits easily in a mens dress shirt pocket. Personally I find the larger size a cheap price to pay for the vastly longer battery life afforded by the larger AA battery.5. Ergonomics. The digital radio has a recessed switch that locks the radio at its current setting, whatever that is, on or off. This is quite necessary, because it's so easy to accidentally bump one of the protruding buttons, either shutting it off or popping it over to a different station. By contrast, the on-off switch, volume control and tuning dials on this analog radio are relatively immune to getting changed by bumping them accidentally.6. Reliability. Both seem fine this way, and both resistant to breaking if you drop them accidentally (without reason). I did notice that after owning it for years, the digital radio's presets got a little screwy--sometimes they'd all change to whatever the station was for preset #1.7. Added features: the digital radio has a clock; the analog doesn't. The digital has a weather station setting, which I never was able to get to work (i.e. really bad reception), and the TV audio capability was useful until all the TV stations went digital, and then it didn't work.All in all I prefer this analog radio to the digital one, in part because the battery life is useful to me, and the larger size isn't so much bigger that it makes any difference to me (both fit in a pocket). A digital radio is inherently better, but Sony would have to redesign theirs to make it truly better than this cheaper analog version.I'm not commenting on music reception because I mainly use it for talk radio.\",\n",

So wearing these during yoga or other vigorous activity may not work. The sound is very good and I do not experience the hiss some have mentioned, at least within my 900 sq ft. condo. It all hooks up easily (in my case to my stereo receiver).  I have noticed some interference (again it's a condo), but the ability to change channels and fine tune makes it pretty easy to solve. I think the range gets overstated. I was able to get a (fading) signal about 100 feet down a corridor (while doing laundry) but lost the signal in the thick walls of the laundry room. No biggie. In terms of comfort, I find my ears and neck start to feel a little strain after a couple of hours.  That's to be expected.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I read all the reviews here and elsewhere prior to deciding to buy this router. I have to say I am very impressed! I upgraded to this router from the MR814 802.11B router. This router is identical to the MR814 except that it's about 1/3rd the size! It literally fits in the palm of my very large hand!When I took it out and connected it, I found that I didn't need the software Cd that came with it as it is mostly just help files anyway and I was able to figure it out on my own.Setup was a snap and I was done within 10 minutes.Nice Features:- 10/100mb WAN port! Most routers only have a 10mb WAN port. Odds are that your cable modem or DSL isn't faster than 10mb right now, but this router will support 100mb if you ever upgrade your connection! One thing to watch out for with this: The WAN port is set to Speed: Auto by default and some cable modems don't like that (mine didn't), so you go into the setup page and change the WAN port speed to 10mb on a simple drop down menu. This is documented in a separate notice in the box that you can't miss (good work Netgear).- Tiny!! This thing literally takes a fraction of the desk real estate my old one did!- FAST! I use this with a Netgear WG511 802.11G wireless laptop card and it is FAST! Connection speed is great even through 5 sheetrock walls (one floor Ranch style house).If you're not a very technology saavy person (your kid has to program the VCR) then use common sense: READ THE HELP FILES ON THE CD!!! Netgear put quite a bit of info on the help files on the CD (which you can also get from their website). This router is not complicated to get going. All you have to do is follow directions.Here is the general rule when setting up and troubleshooting router/broadband connections:- Setup your router using the wizard in the setup web page- once setup is done turn off EVERYTHING! That means that your Cable modem, router, and ALL pc's connected to the router should be turned off!- Turn things back on in the following order waiting 30 to 60 seconds between each:-Cable Modem-Router-PCThis will fix 99% of lost connection problems.Overall, I'm thrilled with this router (did I mention it's tiny?).\",\n",

This is fairly difficul and led to scratches on the case before I could even use it.I bought one this summer and it broke under normal use in 2 days.  I never dropped or mishandled it, it simply started showing gibberish on the screen such as $%->?@  etc instead of text... even when I pressed keys in proper order based on memory it would not play.The sound quality was decent, but not what I'd expect from such a relatively high price item.In my opinion, this is not a good product, which I suppose is to be expected from a no name brand... Perhaps they have improved it since June to address these problems, but it is my suggestion that you save your time and money and go with a name brand such as Creative or I/O Magic.\",\n",

You must have a tripod and attach them to it. Therefore, the adaptor is CRITICAL, and this one is all but useless. If I so much as touch my nose to the side of one of the eyepieces, these binoculars begin to oscillate from side to side, taking maybe 10 seconds to die out.I'm going to have to find an aftermarket adapter for this product.\",\n",

I was glad that I had the kodak one as my first digital camera because it was very user-friendly and easy to use.  But I wanted to have more advanced features, such as A/S/M control, white balance, macro mode, exposure compensation. This Olympus camera offers lots of features I was looking for.I must say that if you\\'re a beginner photographer or new to the digital camera, this camera might be too complicated and not user-friendly.  However, for those looking for cameras with advanced features, such as various manual setups and ultra zoom, this is a great camera for a reasonable price range.When I tried to use the Movie mode with Sound (this model has an option of having Sound on or off with Movie mode), there was a constant mechanical grinding noise by the microphone and whenever I recorded the movie, it would record that annoying noise too.  I called the technical support at Olympus.  The person I talked to told me that that was \"normal\" for their digital cameras.  He could not offer any solutions to get rid of that noise.  I was so disappointed about this fault.  However, yesterday when I was trying different modes and options on this camera, I discovered that turning off \"FULLTIME AF\" option from Movie Mode Menu gets rid of that noise.  \"FULLTIME AF\" mode is offered in both Still Camera mode as well as in Movie mode.  In order not to have the grining noise recorded in your movie, you need to turn off \"FULLTIME AF\" from the Movie Mode menu option.',\n",

They gave their life to protect my new washing machine, side by side fridge, and a garage door opener. All these devices continue to function. Would have had huge repair bills to fix those. I am getting 5 more to replace the failed ones. Cheeeeeaaapp protection! Nuff said.These cubes protected just as well as a Tripp Lite 3800 joule which also died in that surge.Had a surge in December too. Lost an alarm panel, and had to pay 300+ to replace a defrost module in that same fridge. That module would probably would have burned again if I didnt have a SurgeCube on it. All the new fridges have very expensive motherboards now. You better protect it.Called BGE, not very helpful. They need to check the transformer next to my driveway. They assigned a case number. Who knows when and if they will check it.Edit: Had a very experienced electrician check my homes wiring. All perfect.BGE did a load test on the transformer. No problems found.

If you are unsure of what piece goes where the instructions do assist with this, but there are not many parts so I don't think many people will not understand what will go where. I would have much preferred large detailed instructions detailing installation procedures for different wall types, and speaker weights.2.  The supplied wall anchor is completely useless. It is not strong enough for drywall and is unnecessary for mounting on a wall stud.3.  The allen key that comes in the package is completely inadequate. in my situation there was no way possible to get enough torque on the key to lock the speakers in place.The GoodThe mount offers the most placement flexibility of all the others.  The mount, ball, and speaker bracket appear to be made of heavy duty metal that has been power coated or painted nicely.  These parts look to be well made and durable.This product will work if you do the following.Do not use the provided wall anchors. Purchase heavy duty wall anchors. The wall anchors provided are insufficient for any load approaching 33%(6lbs) of the rated weight of these mounts.Purchase a heavy duty allen key or an allen key attachment(5mm I think)You will not be able to tighten the allen bolt enough using the provided key. I purchased a long (5mm) allen key power drill and ratchet attachment. That worked well as I was able to quickly screw the allen bolt in place with the power drill and the ratchet the bolt down with enough tension to hold the speakers at an appropriate angle.!!Caution!!..These allen bolts can strip easily.Would I buy this product again?...Yes I would...

The issue appears to be that the plug is a right angle plug which, when pulled out from the netbook or DVD player, it creates stress on the plug and it shorted out the connection.I ordered a replacement because the kids like them.

I have my satellite speakers ceiling mounted, and the center speaker elevated to five feet, and woofer on the floor and to the left of the receiver.The TV is set as monitor, and is connected via coax, and the other components connected are a Sony CD carousel and Sanyo combo DVD-VCR.  Each of these components sound much better through this receiver than they did when connected to an older receiver with which I upgraded to this unit.When I am practicing drums to CDs this receiver provides clear, pure music that seems to naturally blend with my play along.  This is partly because of the high-quality of the receiver itself, and partly because of the speakers and their placement.When in DVD mode the sounds and separation are incredible.Like others I found the remote control to be a bit of a challenge, but once you get used to the layout and buttons it does not detract (in my opinion) from the quality of this receiver.The set-up instructions, and the controls in the unit itself, are easy to understand and use.

       "  'reviewText': 'Nikon released its 1.4G \"update\" of the 1.4D a few years ago.  If you look at the Amazon.com reviews of that lenses, you might think that it was a major improvement over the 1.4D.It was not.The obvious benefit of the G is that it provides autofocus on Nikon cameras that don\\'t have \"screw-drive\" motors built in.  Autofocusing requires a motor to physically move the lens elements into the proper position to produce a focused image.  This motor can be built into the camera or the lens.  Older Nikon cameras and enthusiast-pro level cameras have AF motors.  Consumer-grade cameras (e.g. D40, D3000-D5100) do not. Therefore, Nikon needed to produce a \"standard\" (50mm) lens for these consumers. Nikon has subsequently introduced,  in its G-range of prime lenses, 35mm f/1.8 (with a 52.5mm equivalent FOV, close to standard on DX), 60mm f/2.8, 85mm f/3.5 and 105mm f/2.8. Recently, Nikon announced a 50mm 1.8G, which gives another option to consider.  All of these lenses will autofocus on any and all of Nikon\\'s DSLR cameras.So what other benefits does the 50mm f/1.4G offer over the older D model?Some claim that the G has better AF accuracy than the D.  I don\\'t know, since I don\\'t shoot action photography with the 50mm.  I do know that my keeper rate is no lower than any of my other lenses including the 35mm 1.8G.  However, one thing that is clear is that the G focuses much slower than the D (see the review on slrgear.com).  In their tests, the G is over 60% slower focusing than the D focuses on the D90. Compared to a D on a D700, the G is 150% slower. Notice that focus speed with a screw-drive lens depends on the speed of the camera motor.  The D90 has the slowest motor, but is still substantially faster focusing the D than the G focuses on any camera.As for IQ, most of the review sites find little difference between the two lenses. The G is better at some apertures, the D is better at others, and both are weak at 1.4 (most reviews give a slight nod to the G at 1.4). Personally, I rarely use this lens.  I typically gravitate towards the 35mm for general use (it gives me the traditional standard FOV), and I put on my 85mm for portrait shots. However, I am amazed when I look through my photos at how sharp and contrasty my 50mm D shots are.  I sometimes have to take a second look to confirm that they are 50mm shots and not 35mm shots.  Thus, there isn\\'t enough of an IQ difference to move up to the G. Given the G\\'s slow focusing, you might miss a few shots that you would have gotten with the D.50mm lenses are truly capable of taking wonderful shots.  Given the slight price premium (~$200) over the 1.8, I would pick the 1.4. In a pinch, you will get decent results at f/1.4 and f/1.6.  Your results may not be magazine-grade at these wide-open apertures, but they will be as good or better than most shots you take with a kit lens (any of the 18-XXX lenses).  Some of those kit lenses produce extremely sharp results.  But they are lacking in color and contrast.  The 50mm loses contrast wide open, but the color stays strong.  More importantly, you have shots at 1.4 and 1.6.  Is it worth the $200 premium?  Considering that you get to play with up to 60% more light it is in my opinion worth the premium if you can afford it.  Remember that Nikon charges over $1500 to step up from 1.8 to 1.4 in its 85mm range, so the $200 premium is an incredible bargain.So, if you are on an extremely limited budget and have a D80 or higher end camera, get the 1.8D.  The extra speed is nice, but not essential.  If you can afford it, and are enthusiastic about photography and have a camera that can drive it, get the 1.4D.  Finally, if you want 50mm, but have a consumer-grade camera, you have to get either a G or a third-party lens.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"If you're looking at this, you already know that compressed air just moves dust around.  You want something that removes it from your computers and other electronics.For the past 10 years, I've been using whatever I had around to vacuum PC cases.  Small car vacuums, the hose attachment on my Dyson ball, etc.  To me, it was hard to justify spending hundreds of dollars on a regular vacuum for my house.  So when I saw this product on Amazon, I skipped right past it. ~$200 for a vacuum that I'll only use on electronics?But the cheaper alternatives on Amazon had pretty bad reviews.  So they didn't seem like an improvement over what I was currently doing.So I took the chance and bought the 3M.  When it first arrived, I opened the case and thought &#34;Oh no.&#34;  I had the vacuum, but no hose, power plug, or attachments.  For $200 I shouldn't have to buy these extra!But it turns out, it's not really advertised in any of the pictures I see posted (so I'll post one of my own after this review), that the lid of the case, when it opens, contains a door that's held shut by a small strip of velcro.  You remove the slip, the door opens, and everything's there.  This alone is starting to make the $200 worth it for me -- the convenience of the design.  When closed, the vacuum is basically a closed toolbox with a handle on top.  Everything you need is contained in there -- nothing can be forgotten, fall out, etc.  This makes it great for transporting it in your car, or carrying it around your building.  There's actually a little extra room in the top lid so you can stash a philips screwdriver in there too, or any other small items you feel you might need when using this.I plug it in and start cleaning, and I'm able to get every single bit of dust out of this computer.  When using my other makeshift electronic vacuums, they had no problem getting the big chunks of dust that are highly visible and accessible.  Vents, edges of the case, etc. were no problem.  But they often left behind surface dust, so they still looked dirty.  And some areas I couldn't get at all.  The attachments you get on car vacuums and floor vacuums are meant to get in the corners of your house and car... but not in the corners of a small case.But this 3M vacuum has a flexible enough hose and plenty of attachments to not only get the stuff you originally got in there to get, but also all of the surface dust.  It makes things look brand new when you're done with them.  You can get in-between PCI cards and RAM modules, get the dust within the individual fins of heatsinks, off the blades of fans, etc.  If you can see it, you can get it.  About the noise... it's about the same as the vacuums I've used before.  It's not something I'd use at night when people are sleeping, and the pets still run when I turn it on... but it's about as loud as a vacuum is expected to be and nothing more.I've only used it once, and that was my experience.  Down the road I may update this review as I use it more often but it seems perfect.  The only thing I'd change is to make the manual slightly thinner so it fits up in the lid instead of on the top of the white plastic box.  It's not like I opened it before I started cleaning or anything, though.  You can probably leave that out of the case if it bothers you too much.\",\n",

Make sure of the following:1) Make sure you are using Palm Desktop 4.0.1, NOT anything later.  If you need to uninstall 4.1, and download the older Desktop 4.0.1, it is hard to find but can be found here: [...]2) From there, basically follow Palm\\'s instructions, except:3) Make sure both Local Serial and Local USB are checked in the HotSync menu,4) Check under Hotsync Setup that the Hotsync (virtual) Com Port used matches the PalmConnect Com port under Hardware...Device Manager..Ports (COM & LPT), and5) SET THE SPEED TO THE SLOWEST SPEED (9600).  This is the key to all our problems!Then, after successfully performing a HotSync at the slow speed, you can bump the speed back up to \"As fast as possible\".With this I\\'ll bump my rating up to 3 stars because it works but has poor manual and web site explanations for installing the drivers.Below is my original one-star review from yesterday, for reference:The box says it\\'s compatible with Win98, Me and 2000. Palm supposedly has upgraded the drivers for XP- I downloaded these from the Palm web site.  When installing this (on a new laptop with WinXP with no serial port) according to the instructions, everything seems to install fairly smoothly except that afterwards Hotsync can\\'t find the \"serial port\" it\\'s looking for.  Which of course is the whole point of the device.  I tried the suggestion of another user who said you need to use version 4.0.1 of Palm Desktop.  I tried that and it gets a little farther along- recognizing \"USB serial adaptor\" as the installation device- but still doesn\\'t work.  Very frustrating.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I just bought my third pair of these headphones!  I can't find anything better for my needs - a good fitting earclip.  They have only lasted about 5-6 months each, but the price has been reasonable ($10-20 each over the past two years), so I don't mind replacing them.  I put my headphones through a lot of abuse, and they hold up decently considering.The best part of these headphones: the earclip has a strong wire at the core, covered in a soft plastic/rubber, so I can mold them to fit my tiny ears perfectly!  I have never found headphones with a better earclip - others I have bought (at stores) either have no strong wire at the core or are not easy to shape to fit the ear.Plus, the part that goes into the ear doesn't go all the way inside and is padded, so my ears don't hurt after long music sessions.  Earbud fans who want the earpiece to go all the way into the ear might not be happy with these headphones, but I find earbuds irritating in my ears, so these are a welcome change.The first versions I got were red and black, very simple, while the one I just received (July 2009) is the same design, only it is now blue and white, with the added bonus of a slim/sleek volume control toggle on the cord.Note:  If these are still listed as unavailable, and you want a pair, you might look at the Koss ClipperO headphones listed on Amazon - they look almost the same, though I can't vouch for them specifically.I'm not an expert on sound, but I have never been unhappy with the sound quality, though I can't say I have high standards.\",\n",

I got frustrated with the hassle of unplugging the hard to reach charger on the bedside radio and sometimes forgetting to bring the radio so I started shopping for a radio I could keep in the backpack. I wanted AM/FM and an alarm and a good brand. I like to buy things from people that have been making things for a long time, they tend to get more things right. I did not spend a lot of time on research and somehow I settled on the Grundig G1000A, I think it was the familiarity with the brand name, the shortwave capabilities and availability at a local Radio Shack store that made the decision for me. I really like the little thing. I am a long time licensed Amateur Radio Op and Electrical Engineer and I found nothing to make me unhappy with the radio. Scanning a shortwave band with the manual tuning knob is actually faster/easier/better than with the pushbutton scan feature on my Radio Shack DX 395 bedside radio. Sensitivity on the shortwave bands is just a tad less than the DX 395. The audio is pretty good through the tiny speaker, and really good with the included ear buds. The radio came with batteries, I thought that was a nice touch. Battery life is quite good. The leatherette case is a very nice touch, I can put the radio in it, put the whole thing in the box and put it all in the backpack and not worry about throwing the backpack around. The little radio is a good looking thing and that is something I appreciate. The Black on Silver motif is easy on the eye. Some of the lettering on the front panel is on the top of some plastic and it appears to \"float\" and produces a \"3D\" effect that is just nice. I can not express how I feel about stuff from Japan with black lettering on black plastic!! How stupid can a designer be?? This little radio gets an \"A\" for design all the way around, the tuning knob being on the opposite side of the volume knob makes the unit very easy to tune and adjust the volume and you can operate the band switch with your thumb at the same time. The frequency tends to drift a little bit, all analog tune radios have that problem, this is not severe at all, mine always drifts downward on the AM band so I tune a little above the frequency and can listen for hours without having to worry about it. You have to get the idea that you fine tune the radio with your ear, not by looking at the frequency display, small changes in freq. can be tuned with no change in the display since the display is really an add on.I give this radio a \"5\" not on any technical matter but on the design and the fun factor. I have some fun with it listening to Shortwave and it works perfectly for the main reasons I bought it. Kudos to Grundig.',\n",

It may not be perfect, but according to the box, it will do virtually any 3.5 inch disc, be it CD, DVD, CD-ROM - whatever. In any event, I find it a pretty good product. I've not used it on DVD's as all my DVD's are in great shape.If you take reasonable care of your CD/DVD etc collection, the need for this product is not as great, but like alot of things, if the CD is used outside the home, in the car w/ a single disc player or what have you, chances are it will get scratches, and some enough to cause mistracking.

       "  'reviewText': \"If you're shooting an APS-C Canon and you've decided that you only want EF full-frame lenses for future use on a full frame camera, the 17-40 is a must-have.  The focal range on the cropped sensor is 27 to 64mm which covers a large range for the majority of shots most people are likely to take.  I've found this lens is perfect for social gatherings and essential for group shots.  The size and weight is perfect on the 7D, making this my favorite lens for handling (compared to the 24-70 f2.8L and the 70-200 f4L).  The build quality is superb.  The focus and zoom rings couldn't be smoother and AF is fast.  While this is a sealed lens, I hear that it's not fully sealed until a filter is fitted.  With one in place, the zoom extension is completely internal, so there's no change in length when zooming from wide to the long end.This lens is a fixed f4.  If you buy the lens with the understanding it is not an f2.8 and will not get you the lower ISO and/or faster shutter speed of an f2.8, the lens does very well in most shooting situations.  On the 7D it's even better with the excellent high-ISO performance of that camera (I can shoot at ISO 3200 to 5000 without much concern).  While it is reasonably sharp at f4 across the focal range, it is not as sharp as when stopped down to f5.6.  Also, boarder sharpness falls-off a bit wide open and close to 40mm.  However, these are not big issues.  Contrast and color with this lens is excellent.  My only caution from experience is to be careful when adjusting the point-of-focus to depth-of-field balance with the micro AF adjust on the camera (if you have that feature).  What may appear to be a correct adjustment with a focus scale sheet that uses the center of the field, may end up causing excessive edge softness of your images due to the edge of the frame starting to fall out of the depth of field.  I believe this may be due to the field curvature characteristic of a wide angle lens where the focal plane is not equidistant from the camera lens but slightly curved.  I spent some time setting the correct AF micro adjustment by photographing a large bulletin board with very small lettering and symbols across both dimensions while making sure the camera was pointed square to the center so that all corners were equal distance from the camera.  Once you have this dialed-in, you can test the center-to-corner sharpness of your lens at different focal lengths and apertures and determine whether you may have any sharpness issues with your copy. Initially I thought I had a bad lens copy that was soft and de-centered, but after getting this procedure right, the lens proved to be sharp.While there are other excellent options such as the Canon 17-55 EF-S f2.8 lens, this one is full-frame compatible, it's weather sealed, it has superior build quality, it's an L lens with that unmistakable red ring at the end, and it's the next greatest lens bargain second to the 70-200 f4L.  While the hood may look odd, remember that it was intended for a full-frame camera where this lens would be a true 17-40mm - making a shallow hood necessary.\",\n",

It\\'s a mono-mic. You need the correct adapter to produce a stereo recording/playback. I don\\'t have a great audio system nor am I an audiophile hence the title. The recordings I\\'ve use with this microphone are clean without hum, whine or static. One review said \"It doesn\\'t bend, which was annoying cause it looks like it did. \". I don\\'t find the adjustability annoying at all. I like the snap in ball joint that the microphone has. It allows for an insane amount of angles an positions. Set it at your preferred angle and let go. It will hold that angle. The base is very light but I placed it a nearly vertical angle and then at an angle past horizontal and the base stayed where it was. I understand this is a flimsy model and I treat it with care meaning I adjust it with the ball joint and not with the tip of the microphone. It comes in a plastic bag containing 2 pieces. THe microphone with the detachable ball joint attached and the base. I can\\'t say anything good about the packaging. Do to the very fragile nature of the item I expected more. This was mailed in a lightweight Bubble Mailer bag from Beach Audio. The microphone is UNI-Directional. This means that you need to speak into the front of the microphone. This helps to block background noise but for basic chatting on the internet or for recording for sites such as Librivox.org this is a perfect microphone. I agree with another review that suggests a windscreen. This would also help with splosivess. EDIT: After I underestimated this microphone I set it at a correct distance and there were zero issues with popping P\\'s or other wind related issues. I only use this indoors. I can\\'t speak to what the wind would do. If all you do is press record and expect perfect playback without static you will probably be disappointed. My initial recordings were dirty with some static but with a few adjustments including acoustic echo cancellation and noise suppression the recordings were clean. Some microphones are so sensitive mouse clicks come through with annoying clarity. I have an old school Dell ball mouse so the clicks aren\\'t quiet by anystretch but the uni-directional nature of the microphone allows me to click without worrying. I can also record with it at a comfortable distance from my mouth which is a bit over 1 foot away. Once again some audio adjustments may be necessary prior to hitting the record button.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I previously owned the Coolpix 2100 and I upgraded to the 3200 because I wanted a little bit higher resolution and movies with sound.For the most part, I'm satisified with the upgrade.  The images are clear and crisp and movie function is ten times better than the 2100.  The 3200 allows for 640 x 480 movies and the duration is only limited by memory capacity.  With a 512MB card you've got about 15 minutes of recording time.  That might sound small, but it's more than enough to capture important moments.Another improvement over previous models was that Nikon moved most of the controls from the top of the camara to the back.  As a semi-pro 35mm user I balked at this at first.  Then the utility of this change became obvious - it's just plain easier to have most of the controls right there alongside the LCD viewer.I used the 2100 for Internet shots for auctions and for emailing photos to others.  You don't need lots of megapixels for such uses - even the 2100 is overkill.  Still, it's great to have a camera that allows you to go beyond that and actually print your work.Oddly enough, I found the 3200 to be actually slower than the 2100 in terms of writing to media!  I have one of the fastest cards available so the memory card shouldn't be an issue.  I wasn't impressed.  I don't recommend this camera for situations where you want to take multiple shots seconds apart.Another drawback on this model is that the microphone picks up autofocus noise in the movie mode.  It's quite loud, actually.  It's possible to turn off the autofocus which creates a more blurry image.  Still, the quality of the movies is already low enough that this effect seems to be small.  (Like most digital photo models, the 3200 will not give you camcorder results.)Overall, the 3200 is a great bargain.  It's just enough for printing small photos and it delivers a lot of great features at an affordable price.  Just like the 2100 and other similar Coolpix models, it's compact and feels comfortable to hold.  (I've found the similarily sized Canon digital cameras to be awkward at best.)  Still, this is a camera for folks on a budget.  I know that when it comes time to upgrade again I'll be looking at models with faster read and write times and more megapixels.\",\n",

I had tried a Sandisk Wi-Fi card prior to this, with disastrous results (apparently Sandisk is getting out of the Wi-Fi business altogether). I could not get my PDA to recognize the card after it went into standby, and in general, connectivity was very erratic, and I had to send it back. Sandisk had blamed it all on \"Windows Pocket PC 2003 Second Edition\", which they had not guaranteed compatibility with. Neither had Linksys, but their card had no problem with the operating system.

But I kept reading glowing reviews about this lens.  On multiple websites.  So, I went out and took a look.First impression:  the build quality is not as good as a Canon L series lens.  Duh!  It costs about 1/4 as much for goodness sake.  This is a plastic lens - not metal.  But I must admit that the build quality was pretty darn good.  Better, I think, than the Sigma lenses I've seen.  Fit and finish was very nice and tight.  I'd give the build quality a 4/5.  Not bad.  I figured I could live with it.Next, I put the lens on my camera.  I'd read reviews complaining about the speed of the focusing.  It may not be quite as quick as my 200 f2.8 L series lens but it was pretty darn good and for my purposes, plenty fast.  A 4.5/5I'd read reviews complaining about the noise and the fact that the AF was not USM.  I thought the AF worked very quietly.  Not at all distracting and barely discernable.  Noise - not an issue.Then, I took pictures with the lens and I was absolutely floored!  How in the world did Tamron manage to produce a lens that performed so well optically for such a reasonable price?!  Beautiful contrast, excellent resolution, gorgeous colors, and extremely sharp, particularly above f2.8.  But, f2.8 is very good as well.Obviously the first comparison that comes to mind is between this lens and the Canon 24-70 f2.8 L.  I would say, I kid you not, that this lens is in every respect optically the equal of the Canon or better than the Canon.  I could not believe it.I tested this lens directly against a brand new copy of the Canon 24-70 f2.8L.  Method: I tested both lenses on a tripod @ F 2.8 and 8.0 @ 28mm 50mm and 70mm. Target limestone wall 9.5 feet parallel to the sensor plane. Remote release employed. No mirror lockup. Center and all four corners were evaluated to my naked eye on a monitor using 100% crops. Both lenses were new copies received within the last 7 days.The limestone wall lent itself perfectly to evaluating sharpness and subtle contrast and color rendition. There was enormous detail present in the wall with subtle colorations present.Findings:28MM F8: Tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners28MM F2.8: Tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners50MM F8: Tamron slightly sharper in the center and very slightly sharper in corners50MM F2.8: Tamron slightly sharper in center and equal in corners.70MM F2.8: Canon sharper in center and at corners. Incidentally noted was inability of Tamron to focus as sharply as I was able to achieve with manual focusing.70MM F8: Tamron sharper in center with Canon slightly sharper in corners.Some have said that there is less flare with the Canon, but if you use the lens hood that should not be a problem.  I didn't notice excessive flare in my copy.Admittedly there is significant copy to copy variation in both the Canon and the Tamron, but my findings convinced me that at 1/4 the price, and with the Tamron weighing 1 pound less than the Canon that the Tamron was the lens for me.  Optically 5/5!!I cannot recommend this lens highly enough.  It is the first non-Canon lens I have owned and I am thrilled.\",\n",

The xD \"Picture Card\" flash card comes in three flavors: standard (up to 512MB), Type M (512MB, 1GB, 2GB), and Type H (512MB or 1GB).  The \"H\" stands for \"high speed\" and is the latest format allowing in theory for reads and writes up to 3 times as fast as Type M cards.  Interestingly, Type M xD cards are 20% slower than \"standard\" 256MB or 512MB xD cards.  For capacity 512MB or above, you won\\'t find any more standard xD\\'s; you\\'ll find only M or H ones.To see if your Fujifilm or Olympus camera is compatible with an M or H card, go to their websites and check out the compatibility charts.  (Amazon doesn\\'t allow links so I can\\'t include them here but you can e-mail me if you can\\'t find the compatibility charts.)Sandisk xD cards are, in general, reliable, as long as you stay with 512MB or lower.  Another caveat is when you buy a Sandisk (or Fujifilm or Olympus) xD in store, be sure to get a package that\\'s marked \"Made in Japan.\"  Only two companies actually manufacture the xD cards: Toshiba of Japan and Samsung of South Korea.  Samsung cards, in my experience, have serious quality problems and *WILL* fail sooner rather than later.  Toshiba ones are much more reliable; none of my Toshiba-made cards have failed even under heavy usage.  Therefore, you should never trust xD cards that are marked \"Made in S. Korea.\"  Be sure to shop around until you find Toshiba (\"made in Japan\") cards.  This tip will save you lots of precious memories and from lots of headaches later on.  Unfortuantely, this verification is hard to do when you shop on Amazon or online; I can only say \"good luck\"!  At least you have 30 days to return or exchange when you buy from Amazon.',\n",

Consider instead something that has more light gathering power (a larger diameter lens), and a scope that comes with a sturdy adjustable mount.  This scope will perhaps show the brighter objects to advantage, such as the moon, but dimmer objects need more light, and this scope is just too small.  The mount needs to be sturdy and adjustable (look for an equatorial mount with touch-turn controls).  If the mount is shaky and vibrates excessively when touched, it spoils your view of the object.This scope and mount, less than 50 dollars, cannot be considered anything more than a toy.  If you really want to get a starter scope, don't look here.  Consider a greater investment in a more quality instrument.  Even if the budding astronomer loses interest, the scope, if it is of quality design, will have a greater resale value, or will make a nice gift to someone else.Having witnessed this scope in action, my advice is to avoid it, unless you are just buying an expensive toy.

But I never did like the action of that keyboard, returned the 1st one thinking it was defective. The replacement had the same defect..maybe it's me. Anyway, I needed something. Shopped locally and found nothing. Then I discovered this keyboard on amazon and I'll address the issues people had with this keyboard as best as I can remember them.1)  The color & design is, pick a superlative: ok, fine, nice, great, wonderful. I really like it.2)  Key action. Well in all the writing I've done in the last few days, NOT once, read that not one time, has the Space bar not Spaced. A chronic problem for me with the Apple board. Other Keys simply work just fine, and I like the textured or non-glossy finish of the Keys.3)  I looked at the included CD and decided not to use it, as it seemed too dated. Checked google, went to Macally and discovered a current downloadable driver for the intel iMac. Bit the bullet, downloaded, installed. We all survived, the lights on the keyboard work and so too the USB ports. I've already downloaded pics to iPhoto thru the Keyboard. The Num Lock doesn't work and I use an external sound card so I don't xpect the volume keys to work.4)  I use an audio editing software and have certain dedicated Keys to facilitate my workflow. No settings changed when I switched Keyboards. So,I like it! It works for me, and I highly recommend it. Don't know why some have had conflicts but none here. Got a Mac? I suggest you consider this keyboard. And of course, amazon is absolutely reliable and ez to do biz with.June 13, 2012 an update: No problems at all with this keyboard.

Unfortunately, I found the text to contain shadows, and working with this display gave me headaches after only a short period.  Images looked fine, but text, no matter how big or small, contained shadows and seemed slightly out of focus.I tested this monitor on three separate machines, a Macintosh G3, an IBM T22 laptop, and a custom built Pentium III box.  All support the monitor's native resolution. On all three, the text was shadowy and difficult to scan.  No amount of adjusting the display or the display cards (e.g., scan rate) solved the problem.  Reading pages of black text on white backgrounds was difficult and made my eyes hurt.A few general comments: the cord between the power brick and the display is too short to reach the floor. As a result, the power brick must sit on the desktop, taking up some of the very space that the LCD monitor is supposed to free. The lack of a digital input may be an issue for some, but shouldn't be a problem for users who simply want to stroll the Internet and browse documents.  The lack of a second input is only an issue for those who need to easily switch the monitor between multiple machines.The top-mounted control buttons aren't nearly the problem some reviews suggest -- they're very easy to memorize, and since you only use them occasionally, it's nice to have them outside your regular visual range.  Like many/most LCDs, this one is noticably brighter at the bottom than at the top.  Some Macs (such as the beige G3 minitower, for example), will require an adapter to plug this into your display port.  It's not included or sold by Envision, though their tech support answered my email quickly with a concise and accurate answer.Given the positive reports from others, I'm more than willing to believe that either my machines had mediocre display card technology (though I find it especially difficult to believe for the T22, given the high quality of its own LCD display), or I simply received a bad sample of the Envision monitor.  Either way, I'd suggest buying this from a merchant (such as Amazon.com) with a liberal return policy.\",\n",

At least three times a day, the internet connection would be completely dead, and the router and cable modem would have to be powered down and powered back up to re-establish the internet connection.  After reading many message boards, and seeing lots of people had the same problem with Linksys routers (not just this model), I sent this back.I got a Belkin F5D6231-4 wireless router as a replacement for about 90 bucks.

It is the ONLY piece of software that has EVERY caused a blue screen of death on my Windows XP laptop and it's a VAIO!  If Sony can't get their software to play nice on their own products, how do you expect it to work with anything else?  The interface is clunky to say the least, the conversion is slow, the instructions pitiful, and the feedback from both the unit and the software is so awful that you have to wonder if a first grade student who spoke no English wrote the interface.  It's almost impossible for me to say anything positive about this product because it was so bad.  It took me over an hour to install the software and another 2 hours removing it and cleaning up after it.  It leaves stuff littered all over your hard drive.  Not to mention that now that I've uninstalled it, my Quicktime won't work anymore.  DON'T BUY ANY SONY PORTABLE PRODUCTS unless it's a tape player or a CD player and I'll bet you that with their CD players they're going to start putting in stuff to protect their precious record catalog.

For the price they can't be beat and the sound they give off is amazing.I'm a huge fan of heavy metal, dubstep, ambient music, and even some classical.  All music sounds incredible.  Before I had theKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)I had a 3 piece Altec Lansing set that is no longer in production. While I loved those computer speakers and thought there couldn't be much better I read nearly all the reviews for these speakers and was proved wrong.These speakers offer great sound for ALL types of music, movies, and games.  Great highs, mids, and lows.I live with 2 roommates who purchased theLogitech Speaker System Z623.  After listening to that sound system for several months I must say they are very comparable.  I think the Klispch has better satellites, they offer extremely crisp and full sound.  The bass of the Klispch is also very nice, it's tight, it's loud, and it sounds amazing, but the Logitechs win in terms of bass.  We have the Logitech Z623 in our main living area and the bass that floods that room is incredible.  It's so loud I have to turn the bass to half volume and only rarely hear distortion when it's on full volume.I've noticed the Klispch Pro Media's have gone up in price.  If you want amazing computer speakers at a competitive price then these are the ones for you.  But if you're looking for ear popping bass (not body rumbling sadly) and great satellites at a lower price speakers than Klispch, the Logitech Z623s are for you.If you'd like to hear more about the comparison between the two or have a question about which to purchase for your situation leave a comment and I'll be glad to answer.Note:  The sub did stop working when I was playing extremely loud and bass heavy music.  I unplugged it for about 12 hours and let it cool down since the back of the sub was nearly burning my hand off.  It worked the next day and sounded fine, I'm assuming I just blew a fuse... Thank God not the sub, because then I would just need to get another set.\",\n",

Takes experimenting and trial and error to get familiar with its characteristics (can easily get out of focus), but once you've mastered its characteristics, you will be rewarded with tack sharp, super clear pictures, with beautiful creamy bokeh! As a prime lens you have to be ready to use your feet to move near or far from the subject to achieve the focal distance desired.  This is quite cumbersome for photographers like me spoiled by using too many zoom lenses. I however always carry this lens in my camera bag, for you never know when the right opportunity to use it comes about.  I don't mind lugging it in my bag since it is light weight, small, and does not occupy too much space.  Its large aperture makes it a fast lens too, enabling it to take pictures without flash even when there is low light. A good value for the quality of pictures you can achieve. Highly recommended!\",\n",

As expected, F/2.8 shows a little softness plus the propensity for misfocus on my 40D.  The macro feature is tremendously handy.  So is its downsized construction.  It is my perfect lens for studio portraiture or street candid shots.  With the use of 3 LD lens elements, CA is so well-controlled that I cannot detect any PF or color fringes around high contrast edges at any focal length or F-stop.  What an optical achievement!  I have had no problem obtaining top-notch A3-size prints that show unbelieveable, edge-to-edge clarity.  The only shortcoming that holds this lens back is flare problem.  Ghosting or flaring is quite severe when a strong light source lies within the frame.  I wonder if Tamron has cut corners by not applying the best coatings to its lenses.  Reflections from lens surfaces are quite bright and conspicuous - not the deep purple or green hues that I usually see in Pentax SMC and Nikon lenses.  Despite this weakness, the Tamron A09 is a well-rounded high-achiever that certainly lives up to its reputation for being a cost-performance champion!  Highly recommended.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'OK, before I even start to review this remote, let me re-iterate what the manual allows.  You can dis-able the tilt switch which admittedly is too sensitive.  By holding \"setup\" to go to programming, then hit \"other\" and then the magic 985 code.  Hit Home to get back to regular mode and Voila!  Now you won\\'t set off the glow by breathing near it (yes, the Radio Shack version also does this).That being done, this remote is great.  I needed an all in one remote to control a Panasonic 50\" LCD RPTV, a Scientific Atlanta 8000HD high def set top cable box with DVR, a Panasonic 5 disc DVD changer, and a Yamaha Receiver.  Codes for all of them exist and for the functions that aren\\'t there, the learning allows you to map buttons.  I now have virtually everything at the touch of one remote.  True, the macros may be limited compared to other remotes (The Harmony remotes come to mind) but I love the feel, look, and function of this one.It works at nearly any angle, including 180 degrees opposite the device if there\\'s a wall or couch or yourself to reflect back.  Nothing beats sitting on the couch, and aiming at the ceiling and the signal still gets through.  Someone stated that holding the volume or channel button down does not repeatedly send the signal.  Mines does.  Never saw a remote that didn\\'t.  You can adjust the length of the glow as well, just check the manual.  Some people stated that the glow (default is 8 secs) is too short.  You can set it to 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 secs.  All in the manual.  You can also adjust the brightness of the glow as well.The remote is thin, and has a very nice feel on the backside, like a Fountech Airstyle PS2 controller...very comfortable and grippy.  The metal trim around the remote is classy and feels great too.  It doesn\\'t feel \"cheap\".  The wow factor is high as well, as many people just look at the remote and say..where are the buttons?  Once it starts glowing, their eyes light up!  Granted, it has almost no tactile feedback (you can \"feel\" when you actually press something but it\\'s not as tactile as a normal button, and if you were blindfolded, you\\'d have a tougher time), but I got used to it and pretty much can locate the major \"buttons\" such as Vol and channel without looking.  They\\'re right at start of the curve in the remote\\'s shape and then the d-pad is right in the middle of the curve.  (Note: The next gen Kameleon has raised trim around the main functions so you\\'ll likely see that when it arrives in the US however, don\\'t hold your breath as it\\'ll likely be awhile).4 AAA\\'s give you power and if you disable the tilt switch (motion sensor), then you get just about as much battery life as any other remote.  It has a JP1 port..sorta...lacking the pins, it has contacts that you must hold pins against.  Makes no difference to me as I don\\'t use it.  Bottom line is that I found a great feeling, working, and great looking remote at less than half the cost of a Harmony remote that will control even my HD DVR (just map the buttons with learning).  Power users with mucho devices and macro needs may want more but, you pay for that as well with higher priced remotes.  Check out the pics I took too.  I like it.',\n",

I previously bought another usb adapterI/O Crest SY-ADA24005 USB 2.0 Ethernet Adapter, which didn\\'t work out because its MAC address surprisingly changes every time you plug/unplug the cable. However in order to use DHCP in the university, you need to register your \"unique\" MAC address... so I decided to try this adapter.This adapter arrived one day earlier than expected (already by Prime 2-day shipping). The package is quite nice and came with a driver CD. I installed the driver intended for OS X 10.4, namely AX88772.pkg, which seems to be the most appropriate for my OS X 10.8... After rebooting, the adapter got recognized but I was still not able to use DHCP, so I registered the MAC address in the university database. After a few seconds, the status showed \"connected\"! I unplugged and replugged it just to see if the MAC address would change as the aforementioned product did, to my delight it stayed the same and the internet was again ready to use.I\\'m very happy to get it to work and as a plus, I like the blinking lights on the adapter which give me a better idea of the network status.

Just about all of the frequently used types of adjustment are easily accessed without delving into the menu system.  Once you take the time to understand this camera, you can easily make any shooting adjustment you wish. The design is very ergonomic.I too have no complaints about the battery.  It lasts forever! And if you need to stretch the battery, you can easily work with the LCD off.  If your making an oncamera adjustment and need to see what's on the LCD, it switches the LCD on and then off again when you're finished.\",\n",

They are lightweight, comfortable, and sound pretty good for collapsible portable headphones.  Then I turned on the noise cancellation switch on the small cigar sized and shaped battery compartment.  Whoopeee!  The sound, particulary the bass, got substantially better and clearer. When I got on an airplane a couple of weeks later I had the same Yahoo experience.  The headphones (with the noice cancellation engaged) made listening to airplane audio much, much better, and also cut out a substantial (perhaps 50-70%) amount of the low frequency airplane noise.  You can even use them for that purpose without listening to any audio source.  For the money, a great buy.  Good for everyday use around the home, and great for airplanes, trains or buses.

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve taken a lot of pictures with this camera as well as with many other digital cameras. I rank this camera near the top for cameras in this price range.Rather than going through all of the features, I\\'m going to comment on what I think makes this camera stand out and what I think this camera lacks.Two of the things that make this camera really stand out are:1. It has a huge lens, and2. The lens is made out of glass, not plastic.I believe that these two factors make more of a difference in photo quality than other things, such as a high mega pixel count. You can really see the quality in the photos that this camera takes. The colors are accurate. The images are sharp. And there is no noise when you take a low light, flash photo.Other nice things about this camera:The flash is more than adequate. The 2.2\" LCD is really nice. The movies it takes are decent and you have unlimited movie time. It has a ton of user options and features. And of course, the zoom on this camera is incredible for the size and price. This camera has many, many nice things about it, too numerous to go into here.The down sides are few. One of them is that the camera is big. I really can\\'t consider it a \"pocket\" camera because it simply won\\'t fit in your pocket. But that\\'s the trade off for the big lens and the huge zoom.This camera also has some difficulty focusing in low light. This is the reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars. Kodak did improve on this from the previous version of this camera (the DX6490) but every camera manufacturer should add that little red light that shines on the subject so that the camera can achieve a proper focus in low light. This is the one feature that I think this, and all cameras that don\\'t have a manual focus, should absolutely have.If you\\'re looking for a pocket camera, this probably won\\'t suit your needs. Just remember that most, if not all pocket cameras in this price range have really small, plastic lenses. Usually this means a very noticeable sacrifice in image quality (the Sony-T1 is an example of this).Before you buy this camera, I would recommend you look into the Fugifilm Finepix S5000 and S5100. These are also excellent cameras, but I prefer the Kodak.',\n",

The quality of the materials and the workmanship appear and feel excellent.  The primary focus ring is nice and snug, as is the right ocular focus ring and the swivel action pivot...meaning they will not easily bump out of adjustment.  The image does tend to blur a bit at the extreme edges of the field of view, and the red-blue refraction issue is apparent there as well.  However, in the center (broadly, and anywhere a typical person is likely to look in the field of view), the image is incredible.  The \"edge\" effect is therefore really not an issue.  If you demand a perfect image out to the edge, you can always spend ten times the price on a different pair of binoculars.  With these, however, I can easily see a couple of dozen craters on the moon and I am sure they will satisfy most birders, whale watchers, etc.  That said, I did not like the strap very much.  By comparison, it is cheap.  I guess Nikon expects you to probably buy a better one anyway and they decided instead to put their quality into the binoculars.

(Amazon needs to update its product description.)  Having owned a non-durable Kodak charger and a super dumb Energizer charger, I finally own a smart charger at a low price.  If you use NiMh batteries often enough, to avoid hassles and lengthen battery life, I recommend you get a smart charger that can (1) charge batteries individually, (2) charge up quickly within 1-3 hours (but not too quickly like the 15 minutes chargers), (3) trickle charge.  You can spend 20 dollars for this smart charger or about 60 for a smarter smart charger (like La Crosse or Maha chargers).  To me this charger is good enough, and it also came with a car adapter cord.  It has a small fan to ventilate air to cool batteries when charging, which is a cheap old but very effective approach to lengthening battery life.  The fan may be noisy if the charger is put on a hard surface.  I put the charger on a soft surface such as a bag to eliminate the fan noise.For a 2500 mAh battery, it takes the charger about an hour 15 minutes to charge and then the red light is off and it switches to trickle charge.  For good batteries like eneloop batteries and the ones that came with the charger, the voltage was about 1.25 after red light is off and they are ready to use.  I often take the batteries off 1-2 hours after the light is off, just to top off.',\n",

For one thing it was using up my batteries while the darn thing was off!  I am sure they made alot of fixes, but definitely read the reviews before you buy a Samsung MP3 player.  As for my Intel player, it\\'s the best.  Very reliable.  Haven\\'t had any problems with it.  Very easy to use.  Comes with nice software.  Sound is great, but I think the sound on the Samsung was better.  There are some minor things which are matters of personal taste.  The back of the player is soft and rubbery like one of those soft-grip pens.  I hate that feeling.  Personally, I like the hard, cold metallic feel of your everyday electronics.  You have to press the buttons really hard for it to work.  This is done on purpose so you won\\'t accidentally hit the buttons when you put it in your pocket, although there is a button-lock.  Also, the display is not lighted and does not show the title of the song.  But the thing I found most annoying about this player is that it\\'s damn ugly.  Very ugly to be exact.  I can\\'t bare to look at it.  It claims you can customize the face.  I tried, but worst...just when you think it can\\'t get any uglier, by putting in one of their selection of faces or your own creation, you actually made it the ugliest MP3 player known to mankind.  I\\'m not even kidding.  I am a professional artist and there is nothing I can do to make it look better.  I just left the face blank.  The only reason why I am still using it is because it is very reliable and it\\'s not a battery hog.  And lastly, the headphones [are terrible].  But from what I read in the reviews, all the MP3 players come with inferior headphones.  You start wondering whether they worked out some deal with the headphone manufacturers to increase profit for everyone?  With the headphones this player gives you, not only is the sound bad, but the plugs are so big that you start to experience pain after a few minutes of listening.  Could you imagine that?  You are enjoying easy-listening music and your ears start hurting?  Ironic.  But my grandmaster once said, \"Don\\'t worry about the pain, it will go away\"  So you can heed his advice or just use better headphones.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Okay, in response to all other negative reviews: bunk.I have a WAP11 (and am purchasing a second for my work place), and out of the box it is a breeze to set up.  I have a house separate from my garage/office, and running a wire between the two for internet access is impossible/prohibitive.  I set up my WAP11 with my main network and was able to get a good signal with my laptop and my WPC11 (Linksys) PCMCIA card.  However, the card orientation is not the best for longer distances....Antenna orientation with these units is everything!  On the farthest reaches of my garage (100 ft from the WAP) I received no signal.  But, when I tilted my laptop on end (a bad typing position :-) ) suddenly I receive a 40% signal strength.  I began to do a little research and talked with a couple of antenna manufacturers.  The summation was that this unit is VERY extendable if you want to drop a little extra money on an antenna ...  The antennas on the WAP11 are removable and a much more powerful antenna (with pigtail) can be added.  However, I found this to be unnecessary.  I went ahead and decided to try the WUSB11 (Linksys) and see if the \"proper antenna orientation\" thingy really was the trouble.  Out of the box, it worked.  Throughout my house, and out to the farthest reaches of my garage and beyond!  I did find a couple of weak areas, but moving the WUSB11 (it is on a 6ft USB cable) around a bit got me the signal strength I desired.The WAP11 comes with the unit (with two removable antennas, an important feature you don\\'t find described anywhere, even in the LinkSys literature), a power supply, a CD-ROM with driver and installation software (really unbelievably easy setup, and please, please turn on the WEP feature!), and an easy-install guide.As far as interference?  I have a 2.4Ghz cordless phone and have yet to notice anything (jury is still out), but so far, so good.Really a terrific unit for the price.  Just be aware that there are limitations with the out-of-the-box unit and you will be fine.  I definitely recommend this unit.',\n",

The static isn\\'t an issue unless you get about 70ft from the receiver and are going through walls. At that point the adjustment knob comes in handy to adjust you to a better frequency for the best reception.  They feel good on your head too.  Remember to keep the headset volume level in the middle to high range and the receiver up more to reduce any \"hiss\" sound.Other than looking like you\\'re a DJ wannabe, they\\'re not bad.

But if you're a camera person, the manual mode gives you plenty of ways to alter the photos.  I immediatly got acquainted with the photo stitch program that comes with it and used it along with the camer'a panoramic mode to make some sweet surround photos.  The movie mode is pretty good.  It won't replace your camcorder, but it's great for making little movies for your computer.  I don't mind not having VGA sized videos.  They're usually way to large and I prefer having movies that are better sized for transferring.  One hand operation is easy with the shutter/zoom combo.  The AI auto focus works really well is quite impressive to watch.  I enjoyed playing with the custom sounds/pictures.  You can set your own background picture and record/upload you own camera sounds for startup, shutter, etc.  The flash is really bright and works almost too well.  The only downfall I have found is that to get the clarity that the camera can provide, you need to keep the camera very still between the focus and shutter, which isn't too long.  If I really want a crisp picture, I use a tiny little tripod to get rid of my arm motion.  It takes decent actions shot, but it's no SLR.  All in all, unless you're a professional photographer, this camera is just what you want.  I bought two 256 mb sandisk ultra cards and that was plenty.

I mainly wanted to get the Microsoft mouse because of it's smooth scrolling wheel with side tilt. That is the most wonderful part of this mouse!The middle scroll button however, is very difficult to press down, you really have to exude effort to press it. I am hoping over time, the button will become looser and easier to press.The shape of the mouse, the ergonomics of it, are superb; it really does fit your hand and fingers well. The mouse also has 2 rubberized sides which help you grip and slide the mouse easily across the table or mousepad.The wireless function was incredibly easy to install following the instructions given and the CDrom. The software that comes with this mouse is also very customizable and even lets you adjust the speed of both scrolling, up/down and side2side.Another main reason I bought the Intellimouse Explorer with Tilt is because it does have 5 buttons - 2 for the thumb area. The default setting is forward/backward for browsing the internet but you can customize that. The buttons are easy to press, but the placement of the buttons would have been better if it was under the thumb instead of up and over the thumb area, making it a bit of a stretch/effort to reach and press. The front button should also be larger and moved back, then the mouse would be almost perfect!I'm quite a picky person when using the mouse because it's the most used computer hardware besides the keyboard and CPU! You have to really invest time into a mouse because your hands will need comfort for hours on end...this mouse doesn't disappoint. It's a great choice overall.If you are lucky enough to find the other colors available besides the popular grey/black mouse, go for it! I have the red and it's beautiful.\",\n",

I also compared lots of numbers at various web sites, although not on Pentax mounts.GREAT picture quality wide open and only gets sharper if you stop it down.  I\\'m cursed to be a pixel peeper, but I would not hesitate to use this lens at f/2.8 at any focal distance -- it\\'s just that good.  Vignetting is almost unheard of, which isn\\'t surprising since it\\'s a full frame lens and I\\'m shooting with a Pentax K200D.Zoom feels good and snug -- I don\\'t see myself using the zoom lock button any time soon.Manually focusing feels okay, but a bit of a \"geary\" feeling as you turn the dial, and it\\'s considerably smaller grip than the zoom grip.  Still, it\\'s fairly snug and doesn\\'t have any play in the turn action, so it\\'s decent.Build quality seems pretty good for a composite lens body.----------I have no problems recommending this to anyone that would like normal to moderate telephoto action .  Very crisp images and great color / contrast and a fast f/2.8 throughout.Only one small complaint - Shadow visible in images when zoomed out using onboard flash, even after removing the lens hood.  I guess I should stop being cheap and get a real flash :)Tamron has an excellent lens here and the price is a steal.',\n",

They did that well and delivered a clean music source as promised, while not breaking the bank. I will definitely consider getting these again. BTW, 12 feet was just enough to reach from a top of trunk amp. mount, to the side of trunk, down back of seat corner to floor, under carpet and up behind the dash structure with just enough left for a comfortable connect to the head unit.After using this for a while, I did notice there is a mild alternator whine but only at night with the headlights on. I was able to clear it up by putting in magnetic decouplers which you can easily find at your nearest RS. Separating the run of the interconnect from the power didn't seem to help.

       "  'reviewText': 'I chose 7x35 binoculars for general field use, bird watching, and wildlife study. I had originally planned to buy the more expensive Action Extremes for their shock and water resistance. But on a recent visit to the big city, I had a chance to compare them with these, side by side and was unable to convince myself to buy the more expensive pair.After looking through both the Action and the Action Extreme, I felt that I could not obtain a sharp focus with the Extremes. Puzzled, I asked the salesman to break out a second pair, but again could not focus the Action Extremes as clearly. I was quite ready to pay extra for the shock and water resistance of the more expensive binoculars, but sharp focus and clarity of view trump the other qualities.After three weeks of use, which have included birding, an airshow, and some casual observation of the night sky, I am quite pleased with these. They are lightweight, fast and easy to focus.The only complaint I have is that while the eyepiece lens covers are easily, conveniently, and semi-permanently secured to the neck strap, the objective lens covers are not. The objective lens caps are equiped with molded slots that can be attached to the neck strap, but they work poorly, and are NOT secure. I found myself crawling around in the mud looking for the lens caps several times before deciding that they were best kept in my pocket. This is an irritating flaw in an otherwise well designed and nicely made product.',\n",

The unit is powered via USB; the cable and USB power adapter are provided. The USB connector is similar to that on a printer (the squarish kind, rather than the flat mini or micro blade-like ones I am used to seeing. I found that interesting, but you probably don\\'t--nor care.)You have to switch off the Dolby Digital Out on the Apple TV (by default it is set to AUTO). I mean, you have to do this with any equipment that outputs Dolby Digital --this DAC DOES NOT pass through Dolby Digital. Most equipment will give you the option of turning it off though. Only then are you in business.I tried the Fiio D3, another popular DAC which is priced at half the cost of this unit, but there was always loud crackling whenever I turned on my stereo--the kind that makes you think something is stabbing you speakers to death. The crackling only lasted 10 seconds or less (I am guessing as the digital to analog conversion gets cranking) but enough to make me question my choice of the Fiio D3. It is entirely possible I got a faulty unit, but I did not want to take a chance.This C2G DAC however, is flawless. No crackling whatsover and sound is pristine. At twice the cost of the Fiio D3, it seems to be justifying irs existence very nicely.This DAC has a volume control knob so you can even plug in a pair of headphones. Apparently you can even use it as an \"external sound card\" by plugging it into the USB port on a computer. There may be software limitations, but I can\\'t speak to that, except to say the unit is pretty versatile.Highly recommended if you aren\\'t looking for Dolby Digital pass-through and want a reliable solution.',\n",

At twice the cost of my previous desktop speakers these are more than worth the cost.For a few years I had a pair of relatively good [recognizable name-brand] speakers at my desk. I liked them well enough but they had one major flaw which many people with small desktop speakers will easily recognize: [particularly] when you get the volume down low (so as to not distract from work, to take a phone call, prevent an upset with others in the office, etc.) they get very flat and aren't worth listening to at all; instruments, vox, everything level off and lose their distinctness. The Klipsch 2.1 sound SO much better at these lower volumes than my old speakers that I only regret the years I spent with the crappy ones on my desk.Other observations:The first thing I noticed with these was that I had to keep the bass really low! they have a little mark on the dial which corresponds the the base level for CD/DVD which is about 30% of a full dial turn. I left it just short of that when I was tuning it by ear and only turned it up when some flatter tracks came on which needed a little boost. When a hip-hop track comes on however I am inclined to dial the bass back down just a little (apparently everything above that 30% mark is meant for gaming).Then next thing which impressed me was the depth. The distinctness of notes and tones, the separateness between the highs and mids, etc. which these are capable of (at a regular listening volume, not quiet) leaves them sounding like actual speakers, not what you might expect from a PC/desktop speaker but what you would expect from Klipsch, even in this smaller package.I would recommend these for anyone wanting to improve the sound out of their PC. I would also say that for a dorm or small apartment scenario these would be a fair option. The footprint on the sub only needs about 12&#34;x10&#34; and the satellites easily flank my dual-display setup and would work equally well on a bookshelf, coffee table, on top of a dresser, etc.I would also say that anyone in the market for small speakers and who wants to get good sound for very little money these are a great option. If you don't want to pay $200 but you're willing to shell out $100 I would suggest not wasting the $100--I wish I had done that. Now I'm out $300 and only have one pair of good speakers!\",\n",

It's very easy to use, and very intuitive. While my brother can just point and shoot, it still allows me to do spot focusing and spot metering which if you've never used these features on a camera, you will now--it's that easy. Low light features are great--while the infrared feature is a little creepy, the slow-shutter feature lets you take cool MTV-style videos in low light with great color quality.GOOD: features, compact size, outdoor image quality, ease of use. Little flip-cover is cool too.BAD: lack of windscreen, LCD is very difficult to see in bright light, and the software isn't great. I didn't bother with the still photo feature, same reason why I don't make movies with my G2. Overall, this is a terrific camera and a good value, esp, if the price drops below $650 or so.

Large magnets are very rare in speakers today - it is usually a sign of quality.I ran them for a few days at about 50 watts power of various music  while at work and gave a second listen. They literally blew my socks off. You MUST break these in folks. These speakers are very accurate in their usable range - so accurate I was hearing new instumets in old familiar music!My main speakers are 6 times the size - way more expensive, much prettier and more prestige and have more \"sizzle\" - the high end sings more - but I realized that they were WAY less accurate than these little puppies. These have more \"Steak\" and less \"Sizzle\".As a bonus these are the easiest and cheapest speakers to mount on a wall or in a corner that you will find anywhere with 3 keyhole mounts on the back. PERFECT for 5.1 and 7.1 setups. Got nails or screws? You can mount these in minutes.I turned off my mains and left on my subwoofer - and am constantly amazed at these tiny powerhouses.

I wrote to Radio Shack with a complaint, and they never replied. This Cobra is one fine unit. Even with the inside antenna it performed very well and even better with the magnetic mount external. I was recently on a long road trip and I was able to avoid a lengthy traffic jam due to hearing about it in plenty of time. The only negative is the nine-battery configuration --- that's an odd number to buy. A good investment for any road traveler.\",\n",

For that price or for the $8 it is absolutely worth every penny. This pen stays in my camera bag along with my D50 and does it all. It cleans my filters, my lenses, my viewfinder, and my LCD. Definitely a great purchase. Includes both a brush and a swab/sponge to take care of any foreign objects on your photographic equipment. I would definitely buy another! =)EDIT December 2007:I\\'ve now had this cleaner for almost 8 months and it\\'s still holding strong!  The brush has been very useful to rid my lenses, filters, and even my camera of dust and other things. And the swab/sponge does a FANTASTIC job of getting rid of finger prints, smudges, and just about everything else on your lens and filters. It also works great in a pinch to clean up your in camera LCD screen from those pesky nose-prints and smudges!The only complaints I have are the following:-The swab/sponge sometimes leaves little black pieces of itself on the lenses if you use it really hard to clean something off. BUT, these are a cinch to get rid of with the brush at the other end, so it\\'s not really to big of an issue.-One problem in extreme conditions: Salty Sea Spray takes quite a bit to get off. It takes about three passes with the swab/sponge to get it all off; including breathing on my filter to get some moisture on it to help clean and also \"refresh\" the swab/sponge by \"cleaning\"/\"recharging\" it in  it\\'s own cap which has a little foam in it to clean the swab/sponge.Generally I\\'d DEFINITELY still recommend this product to ANYONE who needs to keep their equipment clean.

Not happy.About the filter. The filter is beautifully constructed.  It is definitely heavier than the similar (58mm) hoya HMC and also an old Tiffen I have lying around.  The reflections on the front surface are very close or identical to the Hoya, and significantly superior to the Tiffen.  The threads are smotth and the filter went on the front of the lens very smoothly.  Better than the way the Hoya does.  I can't tell any visible differences in regular photos with or without the filter. That's good.Now the bad. The filter arrived dirty, with spots and a film on it, perhaps some sort of oil.  It certainly needed a good cleaning before installation and that's unacceptable, and therefore the loss of a star.  All my Hoyas have been clean from the factory.  The reason I purchased the German filter was because I wanted a German filter in front of my Zeiss 50mm planar f1.4, that's all.  Although it is better built than the Hoya, I can't tell any differences, and will perhaps stay with Hoyas in the future.  However, Hoyas do tend to scratch, and if this filter holds up long term, I will certainly pay a bit more for them.\",\n",

Being a perpetually poor audiophile who then had an excuse to buy nice headphones on somebody else's dime, I settled down to research. After hours and hours of looking and reading ratings and trying on different styles in the stores, I finally settled on the Sony MDR-V6, having been warned away from the newer Sony model that was supposed to replace them. Obviously the ear cups haven't died yet, but I know they will in a few years, and I don't mind at all.I just got them in earlier this afternoon, and I haven't taken them off since without it being absolutely necessary. I've been listening to music for hours now. The biggest fear I had with buying new headphones was that they wouldn't be able to reproduce both sharp highs and smooth lows with clarity and without sibilance. After about an hour of listening to Emilie Autumn's electric violin, which has both in abundance, I have to say that my fears were laid to rest. I then moved on to the rest of my music library, and so far - with only a few hours of breaking-in - it all sounds amazing. Metal, rock, classical, reggaeton, electric, jazz, trance, everything. There's a touch of bass that I can't usually hear, and I'm not sure if that's enhancement from the phones or just because I can actually hear better now, but I like it.All in all, one of the best not-a-textbooks I've ever bought, and I see myself loving these way after this class is over.\",\n",

Here are some of the drawbacks to this little guy:-The camera is easily losable because it's so small.-It's so small it's difficult to see the picture on the little LCD screen; to me that is the purpose of getting a digital camera, so that you can see the picture you took; and if it's not good enough-take the picture again!  With the LCD screen it's hard to tell the quality of what you really captured.-The camera doesn't feel right in the hands; it fumbles around my hands several times because it's so small.-Battery life is not that impressive.-The camera is slow to 'reload' for the next shot.Unless you really need a &quot;small&quot; camera, which by the way is still too bulky to put in your jeans pocket -- I'd go for the regular size camera.  This camera had nothing on my Kodak digital camera (sorry).Mine was returned back to the store before 30 days for a full refund - it just wasn't for me.Good Luck.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought this lens mostly for its incredible sharpness and optical qualities. Its very fast maximum aperture (f/1.4) was only a secondary consideration. I took it on a photo shoot yesterday and was not disappointed. I took nearly 200 pictures with it. The sharpness, clarity, and color saturation of the images it produced are on par with my best \"L\" series lens, which cost considerably more than this one!Please be advised, however, that sharp, crisp images require an aperture of f/4.0 or smaller (higher f numbers, up to f/22). Opening the aperture more than f/4.0 results in softer images. At f/1.4, the images are very soft, much softer than I am willing to accept. To maintain image sharpness and overall quality, I found it best to increase ISO as needed in order to avoid using an aperture wider than f/4.0 (or use flash).Also be advised that this lens has no IS (Image Stabilization), meaning that the shutter speed should not be slower than about 1/50 second. If you go below 1/40 second, blurry pictures can be expected.Finally, note that this lens only functions as a 50mm, \"normal\" focal length lens on full-frame cameras. If your camera has a 1.6 crop sensor, as mine does, this lens will be the equivalent of an 80mm short telephoto lens.In summary, if you want a lens that takes incredibly sharp, clear, crisp images at apertures of f/4.0 and higher (up to f/22), this lens will make you very happy. But if you want a lens that produces very sharp, high quality images at wider apertures in dimly lit, available light situations, you would be happier with the 50mm f/1.2L lens, which handles low light conditions much better. But that lens costs about 4 times as much as this lens!',\n",

It does not have IS, which may be an issue to some but I don\\'t have any IS lenses so maybe don\\'t know what I\\'m missing. The optical quality is as good as advertised. On an APS sized sensor (like my Rebel XTi) the lens is equivalent to a 320 mm on a 35 mm film camera. It is the longest lens I own. This is good for \"urban\" birds and squirrels that let you get reasonably close, and may be good for larger wildlife. It is borderline for, say, small wild birds that will not let you get close enough to reasonably fill the frame even at 200mm (but I have gotten lucky here and there).I would guess it is good for sports, but you need enough light to allow a reasonable shutter speed at f4.I have used it for macro closeups, and you get great bokeh.You can get creative with it. Why use a lens this long indoors? Well, why not?There is an optional tripod collar. The lens weight is at that borderline where you should use some lens tripod mount to avoid damaging the lens mount. I wish this collar were included, or at least cheaper and more widely available (it seems to be about $130 for a metal ring with a tripod socket -- come on, Canon!)It comes with a lens hood, so don\\'t order an extra.',\n",

The tuning on mine is very coarse making fine adjustments difficult when trying to improve AM signal reception. Attempting to tune in and listen to weak distant AM & FM radio stations is difficult on the AM band and basically impossible for FM because the radio appears to filter/squelch out weak signals. For comparison on AM reception I placed my new Sony radio side-by-side next to an old General Electric AM only solid state radio and slowly advanced the tuning on both...and it was amazing how many more weak but good radio station broadcasts I could pull in using the older radio. Using a tunable AM loop antenna with the Sony improved both the reception and fine tuning issues for the AM band, but I can't see myself frequently carrying a loop antenna around wherever I might want to take a portable radio, and this provides no help with improving signal strength on the FM band. In conclusion, the Sony is a decent radio for listening to strong local radio signals, but I'd buy a better radio than this model if I lived far from the radio stations I wanted to listen to.\",\n",

The reviews do not lie...these are absolutely perfect for my purposes.I use these with my MP3 and PMP players, as well as my Blackberry Curve if I'm listening to music on it, and have found the sound to be phenomenal.  Now, I'm no audiophile but these definitely give me more detail than previous headphones I've owned so I'm very happy with them.  They are also extremely comfortable...I needed some over-the-head phones because I've always found earbuds and over-the-ear phones to be painful after awhile (I wear glasses, which are a definite factor).  These have been very comfortable on my ears and I can wear them for hours.  I have not had the hair catching issue that some people mention, so I've been lucky with that as well.Definitely worth the price, and if they ever break down I know Koss will provide me with a new pair.  I know they may look a little strange, but I've never had people comment on that - they just want to know if they are good and what kind they are.The only con is I wish the wire to connect to my devices was a little longer - not a lot, but just a few inches to provide a little extra give.  However, most headphone wires are WAYYY too long, so this is a very minor con.These are not noise-cancelling phones, and they were not purchased for use on planes (I have some foam ear buds I use for that purpose) so I can't comment on how they would work in that situation - I think too much noise would definitely get through.  So just use these in everyday situations (walks, in cars when others are driving, etc.) where it is actually a good thing to hear some of what is going on around you for safety purposes.All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to anyone.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I looked long and hard at earphones before I bought this one, but that in NO WAY says that I know all there is to know about them (not even a fraction actually). Simply because there are just so many earphones you can get to try before you buy.I was skeptical about what kind of difference there might be between a $5 set and a $30 set. I\\'m pleased to report that the difference is worth paying for :)It\\'s not like I\\'ve used a whole magnificent range of earphones to be able to notice a difference. I\\'ve been a stock earphones user, and moving to this one...there is a HUGE difference in sound!The range and clarity is GREAT! And more so is the sound-isolating properties. I figure it\\'s the great fit of the earbuds inside your ear-canal. So it\\'s imperative that they be inserted correctly (They plug your ears to the outside sounds). As an experiment - plug your fingers INTO your ears and hum to yourself - that\\'s the way it actually works! The humming is just to give you an idea of how the sound quality will change for you ;) (Yeah I know that your own sound travels through the bones and not through air...but the effect here sounds just like it).I did notice what the others mention as \"heavy bass\" of the sony phones, but I can definitely live with that. It\\'s not like the sound is all bass...it\\'s just a tad more than what I\\'d THINK the music will ACTUALLY sound like. But it\\'s all good (yes folks..it really is).After this... I\\'m pretty sure that even more expensive earphones must be something special (when I hear through these... i can imagine those tiny differences that might improve even this quality). But at present I wouldn\\'t like to spend $70 on another pair of earphones...so I\\'m sticking to these - and loving them :)cheers!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This lens is a good \"walk-around\" lens. A walk around lens needs to be small, lightweight, still reasonably fast, and should range from medium wide to short tele. Nikon\\'s kit lenses have all incorporated these features more or less. The problem is that the demanded versatility and portability sometimes requires compromises in terms of image quality and built quality.Therefore you have to ask the question, if it would be better to spend money on a decent point-and-shoot camera instead of spending it on a compromise lens. You bought a SLR for a special purpose, and a kit lenses will most likely defeat some of that purpose, whatever it was.Anyway, this lens does it\\'s job pretty well. In my opinion it has the perfect range for a walk-around lens. It\\'s small and lightweight.Compared to other available \"compromises\" there are some pro\\'s and con\\'s:Pros:- optically maybe Nikon\\'s best kit lens according to various tests on the web.- longer telephoto reach than the cheaper 18-55 mm lenses.- better built quality than almost all Nikon kit lenses (metal mount).- with f/4.5 at the long end it\\'s faster than other kit lenses and Nikon\\'s 16-85 VR (which is otherwise in a different class for price and built quality).- way lighter and cheaper than pro alround lenses (17-55 f/2.8)- Bokeh is not bad and seems to be much nicer than in many of Nikon\\'s other DX zooms.Cons:- no VR. In my opinion this could be a deal breaker. VR works great for what it is made for and you get it now in all newer cheap lenses basically for free. The faster long end of this lens (f/4.5 instead of the usual 5.6 now) will help your low light focus but the it won\\'t compensate for VR in terms of camera shake. The difference is not big enough.- funny built: the mount is high quality and the lens body seems strong. but the front element that pumps when zoomed wiggles losely, the zoom action is very uneven.- some people report dust-sucking problem.- distortion and chromatic aberrations (if you shoot RAW) are an issue if you look closely. Both can be corrected easily, but it requires time, unless you use DxO.In summary, a relatively cheap crop frame zoom will never be a perfect lens. But if you need one of the cheapies, I think this is one of the better ones, at least optically.I think Nikon discontiued it\\'s production, thereby forcing customers to step down to full-plastic-lenses or step up to better built alround lenses at $600 or more.',\n",

I think the extra money is worth it as compared to the 50mm 1.8  Of course each person has to decide for themselves, with the wide range of zoom lenses available that give very good performance it can be hard to justify a single fixed focal length lens.  I wanted it for portraits and am very very pleased with this glass. I do and will be using it a lot so it makes the decision easier for me.It is a bit soft at 1.4 and that is by design. It becomes sharper rapidly as you close down the aperture, by 2.0 it is sharp by 4.0 it is unreal. That is the only way to describe it, unreal in it's clarity.At 1.4 you can capture all those low light art shots you never could before.

       "  'reviewText': \"Just got these today. My second pair of Microsoft LifeChat's croaked on me (seriously don't buy those pieces of junk!). So I was looking for a cheap pair to replace them for now. It's an interesting setup that these headphones use to connect to the PC. Instead of a all in one USB connection they use both standard audio/mic jacks and only use the USB connection to power the vibration.As far as the sound quality goes, I was a little disapointed in the bass at first... it simply didn't have much. Then I turned on the vibration feature, the best way I can describe it is synthetic bass. It almost adds a quality as if your standing next to a drum set and you can feel the bass. I'm not sure how it will perform in games and movies yet but if it comes through with explosions and gunfire, it would be pretty cool. :)They are fairly comfortable, and I have a huge melon. The earpiece cushions are tight on the headpiece though and not as cushy as the lifechats. The inline controls are simply consisting of a disk dial for volume and a switch to turn on the vibration from off/low/high.My only disapointment so far is the mic, testing it... it seems rather weak. I have to speak loudly to get it to pick up my voice. I have yet to test it in Ventrillo so hopefully I can tweak it to my liking.As far as durability, no score right now, we'll see how they are in 3-4 months. Overall a good pair of headphones for the price. It's hard to find decent ones around the sub $30 range and these are exceptional for the price.Finally, one reviewer claimed these were mono headphones, this is untrue! They are full stero (sounds on the left comes out of left speaker etc)This is important for gaming and I wanted to correct that wrong information. :)\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The Samsung 213t is significantly cheaper than other 21.3\" monitors, although it should be noted that you\\'ll spend a lot less on a 20\" monitor. So if you\\'re looking at this one, you\\'d better value that extra inch. Should you? This depends on whether you like high pixel density or low pixel density. The 21.3\" monitor yields about 94 dpi (dots per inch); a 20\" monitor is more like 100 dpi. Some of the smaller 1600x1280 displays (especially for laptops) go above 120 and even 130 dpi, and some people prefer the high density, even though the text gets smaller. WinXP has a setting to increase font and dialog box sizes based upon the local dpi, but this is imperfect, since graphics, unlike fonts, are not resized. We can argue theory forever, but the essential question is, what do you find easiest on your eyes? For me, the lowest dpi is most comfortable, because it draws larger characters, but I know of people who prefer the high numbers. If you\\'re like me and you want low dpi and a lot of screen real estate, this is your monitor, at least in 2004. (There\\'s a wider model, the 243t (24\"), but it costs about twice as much.) The 213t price has been dropping over the year (with periodic rebates!) and may drop farther, and this model may well be replaced before long.With any modern LCD monitor, be sure to use the digital connection to a DVI video card. The digital connection assures that the monitor will display *exactly* what the PC intends. If you use the VGA analog connection, you\\'ll be open for some smearing and ghosting.The 213t has no frills (no speakers, no USB). Its response time (25 ms) isn\\'t as fast as some other monitors, so it\\'s not the optimal choice for gaming or video. But it\\'s a sharp, clear, large display. For the market niche it fills, it\\'s the best monitor at the best price.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'m not really involved in the digital photo scene so this won\\'t be a super technical review.I purchased this camera because of the size. It\\'s about the size of a mobile phone, smaller than some, larger than others. It fits perfectly in the phone sized pocket of my shoulder bag.Operation is mostly simple. Power it on with one button, focus and shoot with a different button. The location of these two buttons is pretty ergonomic - they make sense. I haven\\'t taken a single picture with part of my hand shadowing the flash or found any fingers in the shot. In the past 14 months, I\\'ve taken over 2500 pictures with this unit and had no fingers in the pictures, so I think that\\'s pretty ergonomic for a small camera.The zoom is digital which makes it useless - if you zoom in, you can just see bigger pixels, so don\\'t buy it for the zoom, ok?Manual operation is hit and miss. Some of the settings I\\'ve found to be superior to the default point and shoot mode but for the most part I think you\\'re better off using it in automatic mode. For one thing, it\\'s really hard to find a setting where you can turn the flash off without leaving the shutter open forever. That means I can\\'t use the camera in many museums because most restrict the use of a flash. Of course, a DIY fix for that would be to cover the flash securely with something like electrical tape, but I really don\\'t like the idea of that.Battery life is long, if you use the actual Canon batteries. I purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries and they only last for a couple hours of turn on, take a couple photos, turn off and repeat. So for vacation when you really need to rely on a spare, buy an actual Canon battery. It\\'s worth the extra dough.The case that comes with the unit is quite nice. You shouldn\\'t need to spend more $ to buy another one. I don\\'t like the velcro on the case so much because it gets stuck on the little camera strap and makes the strap look all scuzzy, but maybe you can find a better strap. Any cell phone strap could be used. Try to find one that will fit around your hand for security. I\\'ve dropped the unit once and it\\'s okay so far but I wouldn\\'t want to risk any damage.The battery charger is small - no cord. On the US model it plugs into any two prong outlet. Doesn\\'t work well on a power strip because it has a large footprint. But on a regular double outlet with a normal plug in one, this charger will fit just fine in the other outlet. On a totally dead battery it takes about 35 minutes to fully charge it.The manual is descriptive. Keep it handy when you\\'re getting started. Don\\'t just use the quick start guide. You\\'ll want to know how to use those manual settings from time to time. Take it with you on vacation.Video mode is okay. The mic is quite sensitive - better than I had suspected. You won\\'t get a particularly large image but you can find video editing programs that will enable you to enhance the video you record. For fun little snippets to send to friends via e-mail, which is what I wanted, it\\'s great.Sorting through the images and videos is extra simple. Deleting unwanted images is just as simple. Be careful, or you might delete something you meant to keep.The unit does come with a 16mb SD card but that\\'s too small for use in reality. Go to the store and buy a 256 or a 512 MB card and you\\'ll be able to take way more pictures than your battery will allow. You should not need more than one 512 for a 10 day vacation. Seriously. I like that it uses SD cards because they\\'re still quite easy to find. And unlike other camera brands, you can buy any brand SD card.I can tell you that some SD cards are faster than others, which will affect your between snapshot time more than the camera itself. I\\'m using a PNY card and it\\'s much faster than the card that came with the camera. Unfortunately, most of those cards are made by 2 or 3 manufacturers and then rebranded by the sellers. If you feel that it takes too long to take one photo after another, try a different card. Don\\'t blame the camera.There is a cable included to directly connect the camera to a device. You could use that but honestly I think it\\'s easier to take the card out and insert into a card reader. Many computers have them built in. If yours doesn\\'t, you can buy a reader at any electronics retailer for about $9-30 depending on how many types of cards it can read. All you need is SD reader.Would I buy this camera again? Yes I think so. It\\'s not everything I wanted but almost everything. 4MP is still nothing to sneeze at - the images are quite good. Usually the only modifications I have to make are to orient the photos 90 degrees(I take a lot of portrait shaped pictures, which default to view sideways when you look at them on your computer.)Buy with confidence and enjoy this little thing. Every time I use it people still say \"wow it\\'s such a small camera!\" If that\\'s important to you, you\\'ll really like it.',\n",

When you open up the packaging, make sure you check BOTH ends for all the accessories.I\\'m using this power strip for power distribution on my 19\" equipment rack.  I\\'d give this product 5 stars, but I\\'m deducting one since the brackets don\\'t work out of the box for me.  I\\'d imagine others would have the same problem, since the mounting hole placements on the rack should be pretty common amongst different brands of racks.The problem is the power strip is 1.5\" wide and thus, the brackets need 3/4\" clearance on either side.  I have a shelf mounted on the rack, and the distance from the edge of that shelf to the center of the mounting hole is 3/8\".  The center of the mounting bracket needs to be shifted another 3/8\" to the outside, in order for the power strip to rest snuggly against the shelf.  The brackets do have a crosshair cutout, but the channels aren\\'t quite wide enough to fit the rackmount screws through them.  As is, you have about 1/8\" of wiggle room in mounting the bracket.  If you don\\'t use the supplied washer and dremel just the slightest bit of metal away from the crosshair\\'s channel that you\\'re using, you\\'ll be able to fit the mounting screw in the channel and get another 1/8\" of wiggle room.  Thus, I had to extend the channel another 1/8\" to the edge in order to be able to mount the power strip right up against the shelf.

       "  'reviewText': 'Of the Canon consumer lenses the 28-135 MM may be one of their best and most useful lenses, a great value for the price: practical everyday focal range, good IS, fast focusing, quiet USM, and decent IQ. Lens build is not up to highest Canon standards--my lens has a little bit of shaky feel, but still operates well and USM works smoothely. I also have a 17 - 40 MM f/4 L and a 70 - 200 MM f/4L IS USM Canon lenses, which I are both incredible and superior. However until I can afford a $1,000+ Canon 24 - 70 MM f/2.8 USM L  or 24 - 105 MM f/4 L IS telephoto, the 28 - 135 MM is a capable walk around lens.If you cannot afford the much more expensive Canon L mid rage telephotos--the 28- 135 is the next best thing.

It's often reviewed as producing better results than the G-version and that's what mattered to me.But OMG.  Right out of the box it was falling apart.  After a cursory look for dust and grease, and for  anything else obviously wrong, I put on a Hoya protective filter and it felt loose.  I took the filter off and tried again.  I don't torque filters to a lens, I handle them both gently, and thought I hadn't engaged the threads properly or that I hadn't tightened the filter all the way.  I tried three times, being increasingly careful each time, and it still felt loose.  Only as I was removing it for the fourth time did I see that the barrel of the lens at the objective side was what was loose and jiggling-around.A 50mm PRIME lens that can't hold the lens elements in alignment is slightly more useful than a cardboard toilet-paper tube, and the test images proved that.Rats!  I'm sure these are made in huge quantities and one or two bad ones are bound to get through - you can't test each and every lens - but I still feel that it shouldn't have been possible for a defect of this nature to get through.Look at it carefully when you open the box and when you buy online, only use vendors like Amazon who make it easy to return a defective item.NOTE:  I also purchased a 70-300 Nikkor with a Vibration Reduction system that didn't work (diagnosed by Nikon USA who were very helpful).  Nikon wanted me to send the lens to tem for repair and/or replacement, but since it was new and I would have had to pay to send it to Nikon, I sent it back to Amazon, too.  Waiting on the replacement.  Perhaps the gods of photography are telling me they don't want me to get involved again in SLR photography...\",\n",

Sure, the picture quality could always be better--but do I really need to see every pore and zit when I zoom in on someone\\'s face? No.Three other advantages I see to this camera:1) Has a manual viewing aperture. I\\'ve noticed that many of the newer cameras don\\'t. Granted, I\\'ve only had to use the manual viewer a few times, but it\\'s still handy to have, especially when the environment is too bright to see the image in the digital window.2) Relatively light and compact. On my vacations I carry this camera in my cargo pocket and it\\'s not too heavy as to be dragging my pants down.3) Uses 2x AA batteries. I see this as an advantage. My wife had an Olympus camera and was constantly having to charge it. So much easier to buy a pack of AA\\'s (that fit nicely in a little camera carrying case), instead of those lithium-ion batteries where you need to pack a charger and possibly an adapter if you\\'re going to go overseas. Why wait for your batteries to charge in your hotel room when you can buy some AAs on the streets of Turkey?When I think of all the electronic devices I\\'ve owned over the years, this Panasonic Camera has outlived quite a bit. It\\'s nice to see that a company can still make a product that you don\\'t \"use for one year and throw away\". For that, Panasonic gets a huge thumbs up and can expect me to check out their newer cameras when this one bites the dust . . . if it ever does.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'UPDATED REVIEW:Let me say - I\\'m not a knee-jerk reactionary who goes around trashing products for no good reason. In fact, I get a little annoyed when people post 1-star reviews because they happened to get a 1 in a 1000 bad copy.Well, sometimes enough is enough. I ordered two of these and one was DOA as described in my original review. Hey, these things happen, right? So Amazon (not Monster) sent me a replacement. It worked. Forgive and forget. Well, because they were such a good deal, I ordered a third one. Unfortunately, I did not have a need to open it up and use it until today. Guess what? Another screaming piece of junk. 2 out of 3 DOA!  And of course it\\'s far too late to send this one back. Monster\\'s credibility has gone right down the toilet in my opinion (although I did also buy one of the big component boxes for my stereo rack and it has performed admirably, but I\\'m done with their \"power strip\" models. 2 out of 3 defective units is just poor design and horrible quality control.So, there may be a reason the price of these has really fallen.Feel free to take a chance, you might get a deal, just make sure you test it as soon as you get it instead of sticking it in the closet like I did.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3.5 stars):Because of Monster\\'s self-proclaimed reputation, it was a bit surprising to find that mine arrived DOA. In reading the reviews, it seems this is more common than it should be. After nearly killing myself on the horrible blister pack and hooking up all my equipment, I found that the alarm was always screaming when the unit was plugged in. It was NOT the electrical service in my house.It arrived on Saturday, so when I called their customer service number, naturally they were closed. So I took the easy way out and returned it to Amazon (AMAZING service. Reported on Saturday, UPS picked up the broken one on Monday, and new one was delivered on Tuesday. No hassle. Thanks, Amazon!) New one seems to work fine.Does it improve the video and sound quality of my (all digital) home theater? Who knows. I don\\'t want to get into that debate, but I do feel you\\'d have to have very high end equipment and ears to match, or have especially dirty electrical lines, or do a lot of analog in order to definitively tell.I wouldn\\'t come close to paying MSRP, but at the fantastic price Amazon is selling these for, who cares? It\\'s a nifty little device that offers a little extra peace of mind for only a couple of bucks more than a generic surge protected power strip.Note that it also protects your phone line (mine\\'s VOIP, so it might not matter) and TV/Satellite cable. It includes a set of Monster cables for each (a claimed $27 value. I think it\\'s an actual value of less than half that, but still, the cables alone make up for the price difference between this and an imitation power strip.) The stickers they give you for labeling your power cords is a nice touch too.Note: neither of the two I received was blue, as in the photo. It\\'s dark on the bottom, and an odd halfway between gold and silver on the top. I would have slightly preferred the blue, but it\\'s hiding behind the AV rack anyway.I\\'m docking them a star because of the first piece of junk they sent, and I can\\'t scientifically attest to the quality of the results, but based on their claims, the extra peace of mind, bonus cables, and low price, this is a great deal. I\\'m going to buy a few more.',\n",

The 1.8 here is awesome and this lens has beautiful bokeh.Also for low-light at performances, I prefer taking medium distance shots with this versus a zoom with IS.  The lens is crystal clear. If you crop the shot, you still have a lot of information.  Couple that with some nice noise reduction software and you can get great shots of indoor performances.Many of my best shots have come from this lens.Because it is small for an 85mm (approx 135mm on cropped sensor cameras), it doesn\\'t freak people out when you are using it and pointing it in their direction so it can be very nice for candid or, at least, \"comfortable\" shots.  They don\\'t realize how close you are.Frequently I take a Tamron 17-50mm and this lens with me as a two-lens combination.You will not be able to use it for everything because it is a narrow field of view - especially on a cropped sensor.

No need at all for an amplifier.CON - When putting the headphones on, my fingers sometimes get caught in the exposed wires leading to each can. I've learned that when one of my fingers can't let go of the headphones after putting them on, to stop and gently pull whichever finger is caught out of the wire loop lest I rip the wire out of the can.The pleather earpads that come with the V6s tended to make my ears REALLY hot and sweaty in summer weather. I replaced them with a pair of Beyerdynamic Velour Padded Earcushions for the DT-250 from B&H; Photo. Big improvement in comfort and sound quality, especially comfort. The Beyerdynamic pads are cooler and more transparent to sound than the pleather pads that come with the V6s. I should have ordered the Beyerdynamic pads at the same time I ordered the V6 phones and replaced the original pads immediately. When i get my backup MDR-V6 I'm going to do just that.Summary - If your taste in sound tends towards flat, uncolored accuracy (as does mine) and you don't want to spend loads of $, then the MDR-V6 is the one. Bassheads probably should look elsewhere.\",\n",

I understand from other reviews that it CAN be used as a 'combiner' to take two outputs and feed those into one device's input, but this is not what the device is intended to do, that's why it's not called a mixer. :-)Oh and be advised that you will need to use a TOSLINK cable out of your source to connect to the splitter; the splitter does not have a male end to plug directly into the source- all connections on this 27027 are female.The TOSLINK cables snap into the receptacles in the splitter and are held there as you'd like them to be.

The strap you put around your neck is way too narrow and is worthless.  Painful to allow them to hang and I have purchased a different strap from amazon.com to replace the original.2. I wish the eye cups were deeper thus allowing me to have them touch my face on the cheekbones and eyebrows as a reference point.  The cups are too shallow which means I have to hold them away from my face but without any touch it is hard to keep them steady. I compensate for this by using my index fingers as a kind of extended cup to be able to rest them to my head.  However, I wish they just had deeper cups or even a separate add-on item of cup extensions that I could purchase and place on the eye pieces.Overall I am pleased (and so is my wife who uses them occasionally during the games).\",\n",

It\\'s basically a point and shoot camera that makes digital photography accessible even to non-techies.FEATURES:Digital Camera:  At it\\'s highest resolution of 2272 X 1704 it can hold about 20 pictures or so.  The easy to review LCD screen gives you instant feedback on your pictures and helps you decide on the spot whether or not they are worth keeping.  You can add on another memory card to give you even more flexibility with the number of shots you can take.  Plus, at a whopping 4.0 megapixels, this camera is at the high-end of printing and picture resolution in the digi-cam market.  For quality pictures you\\'ll want to stick to cameras at 3.0 megapixels or up, definitely no less than 2.0 megapixels.Easily Works With Your PC:The DX4900 connects easily with your PC and comes with transfer software so you can easily download, edit and e-mail your pictures and videos, thus allowing you to share your pictures easier with family and friends.NOTE:One of the most frustrating aspects about digi-cams are the \"short-lives\" of the batteries that come with them.  Batteries tend to die out quickly, especially if you use the LCD monitor on the camera (which is one of the best things about digi-cams).  Based on other reviews it seems that a lot of users have complained about the \"power issues\" with the DX series of cams (and other digi-cams as well).  You\\'ll definitely want to invest in the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock II which comes with rechargeable batteries and helps make the picture transfer process easier.My investment in the camera dock has helped keep my cameras (I own two) in tip-top working condition.  Trust me, if you plan to get good use of out your camera, invest in the camera dock and NI-MH rechargeable batteries.  It will save you a lot of frustration when your camera does not die out on you at an inopportune moment.THE VERDICT:Overall, if you need a nice, easy to use camera to record your everday (and not so everyday) moments, the DX4900 is a great camera to start with.  At 4.0 megapixels, the quality of your pictures will be the envy of your family and friends.  For everyday/normal/touristy use, this is just perfect.Highly Recommended',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Well, I finally decided to go out and purchase a wireless router. Being that I did not want to spend very much, I opted for this one. This router provides a great list of features, just not out of the box.Size:Unlike Linksys or Microsoft routers which are larger and bulky, this router is small. It measures about 3 1/2&quot; long by 2 1/2&quot; wide by 1/2&quot; high. It's not something that I would put into a server case, but it is something that can be mounted on a wall or tucked away out of site very easily.Speed:With this router, I normally get anywhere between 48Mb to 54Mb connections throughout my entire home and even outside, with throughput being somewhere between 35-45Mb (most wireless routers average out about about 30 so this one is pretty good). The signal strength from the router is fairly strong and I have only dropped my signal once (see notes below). I use a  Xterasys brand PCMCIA card on my PC Laptop, Apple eXtreme G PC Cards on my G4 iMac and G5, and an Xterasys PCI card on my PC Desktop. All of them are 802.11G.Security:Out of the box, the device supports up to 128bit WEP encryption and has support for MAC Layer Address control. A New beta firmware out allows for WPA encryption. On the firewall side, the router uses the basic firewalls: NAT Translation and SPI.Reliability:After getting pass what is noted below, my router is very reliable. I have never experienced any kind of malfuntions or problems. My previous Linksys router may have locked up once every year. I have not had this router for a year yet, but I am expecting around the same.Ease of Use:Unlike a few control panels that I have seen, this router is much easier to use. Wireless encyption happens easily thanks to a WEP key generator (based on passphrases) and a wonderful manual. Other features of the device work just as well. The router seems to be more intelligent than other routers that I have used. For example, I am able to DCC in IRC or DirectIM in AIM without having to forward ports to a machine. A big plus.With all of those pros, there are also a list of cons as well.Firmware:This has to be one of my biggest cons about this router. The quality of firmware on this router reminds me of Linksys a few years ago (in which you waited about 3-6 months before updating your firmware).  Out of the box, the router worked great via the ports, but wireless was a different story. For one, when I attempted to connect wirelessly using my PC Laptop, everything worked great. Then, when I enabled encryption, I could remain connected for about 1 minute, then it would drop out. A minute later, it would come back. Then, the cycle would repeat itself. I decided to upgrade to the latest firmware (which to my surprise was two years newer than the one shipped with hit). The new firmware added new features such as the ability to disable SSID broadcasting. The new firmware fixed my dropping problem like a charm. But, when I dissabled SSID broadcasting, the same thing started happening. The only difference here was that I would drop and gain every second! Since I much rather not broadcast my SSID, I simply upgraded my PC's to the beta of SP2 and that fixed my problem there. My Macs did not have the same problem with the disabled SSID, but did have the same problem before I upgraded my firmware. Then, a new firmware came out which allowed for WPA encryption. Since I rather use WPA than WEP, I upgraded, only to find out that by doing that, wireless stopped working all together! Downgraded back, and everything worked again.Internet Performance:This one may just be me, but I have noticed that I get slower Internet performance wirelessly than I do wired... even when I'm next to my router. For example, I have a webserver that has files on it. I can download those files at around 150-200KB/s. When I connect to the router via ethernet, I can download at around 350-400KB/s.  Although I can live with both, this always bugs me because I should get the same speeds regardless.Specifications:One of the reasons I bought a G router was for the extra speed on devices that have G cards and the compatibility on my devices that have B cards. In the end, I upgraded everything to G. Why? Simply because this router has very poor Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi+ support. If I turn my router to 802.11B only, I get decent wireless B speeds (usually between 8-11Mb all the time). In 802.11G only mode, I usually get throughput speeds of about 35-45Mb all the time. But in mixed mode (G &amp; B support), I get about 2-4 Mb throughput all the time, regardless of if the device is G or B. This may be a firmware problem so I'll wait to see if a new one fixes that (while breaking something else).All and all, it wasn't a bad buy for $40. It does all that I need it to do and since everything is G now, it works pretty great. If you are looking for a starter router that will provide your wireless needs, this one will do the trick.\",\n",

I\\'ve got version 2 of the unit.The annoying issue that I\\'ve yet to resolve is the 108auto setting - which as mentioned here and other places - simply doesn\\'t work. Both the 108 PCI and notebook cards we have drop back to the 54g setting and never make it above that.  If you want full tilt 108 you have to tell the router \"108 only\" - then you are good to go. Not a problem as long as you have all Netgear 108 stuff. Forget it if you want to give access to a print server or PDA. If the 108auto feature had worked - I would have probably given the Netgear 5 instead of 4 stars.Range and signal strength in our large home (3400 sq.ft) are very good compared to my previous two wireless routers. As other reviewers have outlined - Netgear documentation quality is about as good as what you\\'d find on a microwave dinner.  But hey, very few vendors do a good job of that anyway - so really no surprises in that regard.And how about this?  A review that doesn\\'t pass judgement on those whose experience varies with this router?UPDATE: (September 8, 2004) Auto 108g Mode appears to be working now with both 54g and 108g products here - although the desktop PC seems a little buggy still.  I went to the Netgear website and downloaded the latest drivers for the PCI & PCMCIA cards for the computers.  Range - particularly with the laptop has also jumped significantly.  (I don\\'t know if including WPA security on the wireless contributed to my success here or not - but at least the neighbors now can\\'t be wireless Peeping Toms.)  Brought home a new Toshiba Tecra laptop from work with built in G and got full 54g range and speed. Finally...Sacrifices were still made, though.  My venerable Toshiba 755 PDA has now lost wireless access due to the WPA security.  But I\\'m not complaining much since surfing from such a device is hard on the eyes (and wrists) anyway.  Maybe the 108g would work in WEP mode.  I\\'m almost too afraid to try now that everything appears to be working!The router still is rock solid.  Maybe had to reset it and/or the cable modem only once since I first laid out this review.On the horizon?  I just heard about the new 802.11n standard.  The superman of wireless?  We\\'ll see.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The latest 50 f/1.4 EF lens is the best performing chunk of glass that any photographer can buy for anywhere near the price. Granted, the 50 1.8 lens is awesome for it\\'s dirt cheap price, but it is outclassed by the f/1.4 in all respects.Others have already raved about the virtues of this cheap (not really) lens, so I\\'ll just agree with with the strong points, and lay out the broad picture on an open table.First, the 50 f/1.8 is usually a fine lens. It is dirt cheap, has better quality control than anything built by Sigma, and is super light weight. That being said, it does have issues with lens to lens quality, it is \"only f/1.8\", has a plastic lens mount, and is pretty slow in AF.The 50 f/1.4, on the other hand, can darn near allow you to see in the dark through the viewfinder, can focus in total darkness with the right shoe mount flash, records tack sharp images at most all apertures, has great contrast, is light in weight, small in size, has a metal lens mount, and is pretty cheap to buy.It is NOT an L lens in construction, yet it offers L lens optical quality. It does have a USM, but it is the \"old style\" USM, and is not as fast as the modern ring type USM lenses. Still, it is very fast, it beats the speed of the throw away f/1.8 lens to death, and is pretty darn quiet. Also, despite the majority plastic build, and lack of distance data for E-TTL II flashes (the f/1.8 also lacks this feature) the f/1.4 lens does offer a very responsive full time manual focus ring that works like a charm for manual focus, or just touch up in difficult auto focus situations.This lens is all that, and everyone should own it as their first lens. Zoom lenses included in body/lens kits are just plain junk (sorry), but this lens will stay in your camera kit for decades, no matter what camera body is in your future.People who are using 1.6 crop factor cameras like the 20D, 30D, and Rebel line should bear in mind that the 50 f/1.4 lens is effectively an 80 mm f/1.4 lens when mounted on their cameras. That makes the 50 f/1.4 an awesome portrait lens, and the aperture and diaphragm design of the f/1.4 make it unbeatable for capturing shallow depth of field shots with pleasingly blurred backgrounds.As fine a lens as the 50 mm f/1.8 really is, it cannot begin to compare to the 50 mm f/1.4 lens in terms of functionality. Buy this lens today, and it will be with you until the end, no matter what Canon body you use in the future. If you use a 1.6 crop factor camera today, this lens will become a favorite, and the best 80 mm portrait lens you have ever owned.As always, use it with the factory lens hood at all times (only about twenty five bucks), and use a UV filter that is multi coated on both surfaces at all times. Anyone who suggests that you use a cheap filter is steering you down the wrong path. No matter what lens you buy, always use a UV filter that is built at least as well as your lens. Cheap filters, and filters that are not multi coated on both surfaces are just plain garbage. The shame of it is that even Canon offers garbage filters for cheap, and many people who spend hundreds of Dollars on a lens claim that \"If it\\'s good enough for Canon, it\\'s good enough for me\". Nonsense. A cheap filter is just that. A good lens with a cheap filter might impress, but a good lens with a great filter WILL impress. Don\\'t fall into the cheap trap.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Make sure you buy it with the knowledge that you won't be able to use it to the full extent a wide angle lens is used to. Otherwise you will be severely disappointed with this lens. But just how so?I know a photographer that uses this lens for wedding photography with her 10D. For her the lens does the job wonderfully. The lens takes sharp pictures, is light enough to haul around in a wedding, and wide enough on a 1.6 form factor camera to provide sufficient field of view for such event. The field of view on a 1.6 form factor camera would be equivalent to 45mm on full format; almost normal view.I on the other hand used my 28mm lens for nature photography, and let me tell you the results were not just disappointing but down right useless! Simply stated, you will not be able to use high contrast/saturation landscape and nature pictures that are procuded by this lens.  The bright sun will cause sever chromatic aberration in your pictures. Hence, the fringes of trees and light poles for example will display the dreaded discoloration (with this lens the color is generally purple). Every tree branch at the top corners will become purple at the fringes. Those are truly unacceptable results.Now for the big question, is it possible that I had a bad copy? Probably not. After being so disappointed I researched this lens extensively (especially on Fred Miranda site) and found that others had the same problem. In fact, its overall score on that site was 7.4 at the time of my research, thus my 3 star rating. After learning the facts I decided to return the lens instead of exchanging it with another one. Since then I have ordered a 17-40 L.Should you order it? This lens is a great value. In fact, I rank it as a best value lens after the 50mm 1.8 in the lower end range of Canon prime lenses. Nonetheless, don't expect to take stunning nature photos with it; otherwise chromatic aberration will stun you!PS. I agree with most of what a previous reviewer mentioned in his post, but wonder if he owns a good copy. This lens has been in production for a while and there may be a difference in quality between various batches out there.\",\n",

This mount is intended to replace the back cover of your GPSr and then clip onto the handlebar mount.  I discovered that the replacement cover is different than the original one in several ways.  First, it is all plastic with a much smaller, delicate o-ring seal than the original cover (which is made out of metal and has a beefy seal system.)  More importantly, the new cover does not fit on the HCx or others with microSD cards.  Hmmm.  I was ready to return it and I remembered that my new Vista HCx came with a screw mount \"auxiliary mount adapter\" that the instruction manual for the HCx says \"do not discard\".  Lo and behold, screw that baby onto the original sturdy beefy o-ring sealed metal back and it clips onto the handlebar mount perfectly.  This is much better than the replacement back that comes with the mount kit.  Now I have an unused back cover for any non HCx design Etrex to sell.  Garmin does sell just the bar mount piece for suggested retail $10.91, so I lost money on the deal, but I don\\'t have to return anything and my mount is stronger than the original design that Garmin had.

The URC 8910 does a terrific job of reducing the umpteen number of remotes you need to keep at hand.- Setting up the remote to control a DVD/VCR/TV/Cable box or a receiver is a breeze.- The list of codes covered all my diverse equipment - Sony, JVC, Comcast, Toshiba.- The IR learning feature clearly learns those commands unique to you equipment's remote. My 12 year old son easily setup all the remote to control all these equipment!- The volume lock feature is pretty neat as I always use the receiver to control the sound; I can press the vol + or - button without having to press the receiver button again.- The macro keys work well. I have programmed it to turn on the TV, switch it to the DVD input (which takes six clicks itself), turn on the DVD.- With so many equipment, you will have to remember which learning key in which mode (L1 in CBL mode is guide up, etc) you programmed. You will need a short list handy. This is true of any universal remote.- The remote cannot learn commands that operate a menu. For e.g., my receiver's remote has the ability to bring up a menu of audio inputs and then select the input I would like. The IR learning feature cannot be programmed to do this.- I haven't tried the software that others say make programming a breeze. But I haven't had a need for this so far.For about $20, this is a delightful value!\",\n",

I have two TVs about 40 feet apart and did not want to pay for yet another cable box.  Instead, I purchased an HDMI splitter, a long HDMI cable, and this remote control extender kit.  My goal was to be able to control the cable box from the location of either TV and the set-up works great.  The whole deal cost me about $70, which is about 7 months of rental on another cable box.  By chance, I had an extra remote control for the cable box, but a universal remote would do the job, too.  Very happy with how this project turned out, thanks, in part, to this remote control extender kit.',\n",

I've been using aGE 72664 Portable AM/FM Radio, Blackwhich seems to have stood the test of time over ten years and still works quite well outside of some damage on the front speaker grille from being lugged around in a backpack on and off for eight years. It served my needs for just listening to the game or the latest traffic at work when I needed it there.However I picked this up on sale at Walgreens for just near $9, just thinking it would work barely as well as the units they marketed under their Tozai generic brand. It's a $10 Sony radio; surely it's no match for mySony XDR-S10HDiP HD Radio with Dock for iPod/iPhone, which sits in my bedroom and gets everything I desire, right?Well, I have to say I was completely wrong. This little thing is surprisingly receptive, much more than the GE and with a much better dial which measures tuner sensitivity much better. Even though the tuner dial is smaller I can guide it over frequencies much better than the GE and the sound for a mono transistor unit is amazing. I was shocked that something so small can work so well.And I can attest to the radio indeed being quite reference quality in getting AM DX signals; my easy gets from the East Coast (WCBS in New York and KYW in Philadelphia) come in very clear at night and interference is much more minimized, while my local stations sound right. Even between a strong signal from Manitowoc and a Chicago 50,000 watt station sandwiching the signal, I have had no problems receiving CBW, the CBC Radio One station in Winnipeg without any interference from either of them. FM stations come in stong with antenna adjustment, a welcome relief from putting the GE in fun positions (i.e. on its side leaned in a window sill in order to get one station from Milwaukee.This has become my main radio outside of the home or on the go, and I am very pleased with this purchase. It's a good value and product for what money you do pay for it, and I would recommend this radio for anyone just looking for something small to listen to, an emergency kit, or for the game. You won't be disappointed.\",\n",

Overall I am pretty pleased with it, especially given that it came with kit components.I'm slightly disappointed by the fact that the player always plays MP3 tracks in alphabetical order for a given folder (not counting when it's set to random), so when I listen to a folder with tracks from a symphony or soundtrack, they don't play in the order they were ripped.Of course I could append a track number to the name of the file before burning MP3 CDs, but I'd prefer to be able to set the player to process by file creation date (i.e., track order as ripped) or alphabetically.I've sent e-mail to Memorex's customer support with this question, so we'll see what they say.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I happened to see this while I was browsing for accessories. I can't believe it is still available. I bought mine back in, I think Spring '04. I'd had an older digital and it was time to upgrade.  After much searching and reading, I settled on this camera. I have not been disappointed. Even though it is 4 megapixels and I have it set down to about 3.2, I get beautiful, clear, sharp pictures-still. The difference I have found is in the lens. The German made Schneider, Kreuznach lens (not sure of the sp here)makes a world of difference in the picture quality. I've looked at newer camera's (more megapixels) and of course noted the lens type, but to tell you the truth, this little 6440 gets such great quality I can't quite justify getting a new one.Even on it's normal auto setting I am able to catch action shots of my granddaughter sliding and swinging, even water mid-air. I haven't even bothered with the action setting.The only complaint I have, and it really doesn't qualify as one, is the telephoto shots are blurred- I get around that when editing in zooming and cropping, and when I take several shots in a row (not needing burst) the shutter speed slows down. A good choice still for a point and shooter and for great vacation pics.2008--I still have this camera although I have looked at newer models with higher megapixels. I worked out the telephoto thing, I have to hold still, and then it usually turns out clear and sharp. In comparing it with the newer models this camera is still outstanding. Just on auto it takes crystal clear, sharp and detailed action shots. I recently went to a Pow Wow and caught beautiful action shots of the dancing, everyone commented on how professional they looked, like a postcard. And I'm no photographer. And the color it captures is wonderful. I friends and relatives who have picked up I think the Z1012, and mine is better. So other than he low pixels not making good enlargements, I'm not giving it up.\",\n",

So had to go to my network settings and temporarily change my computer to a different static IP address and netmask to get the setup working. Then once configured, reset everything.End to end to get it working, 1 hour.There aren't many reaonably bridge bridges out there which support WAP encryption.

Also my hearing is going, so the ability to understand every word was a great aid for me. You have to rotate a dial to tune in the frequency, but that's a minor nuisance, once you get used to it. Two problems should be mentioned to prospective buyers, however. First, I find the center head piece (on top of my head) to be uncomfortable too soon - like a half hour. I'm assuming that's because they have slots for the charging stand cut into the foam on top of the headset (so there is connection for charging). The headset, for me is loose, so you can't move around much without fooling with it. Second problem, for me, was that the unit stopped working within 4 months. Kudos to Amazon for being willing to replace them. However, if I could have, I would have exchanged it for an upgraded RF unit that Sennheiser makes and would have gone for the difference. The small earpiece units that hang downward would undoubtedly be more comfortable. We'll see if the replacement has problems. Whatever you do, get the RF wireless unit - not the IR units - so you don't have to worry about line-of-site interruption.\",\n",

When I sit normal distance (2 feet) from the speakers, it is absoulutely silent in the room.  Even 5 inches away there is no hiss.

       "  'reviewText': 'If you\\'re considering buying this switch, you most likely have more than a few computers to network.  And if you\\'re the casual home user, this switch will give you appreciable performance at a great price.  As a geek with 4 constantly-on computers with a mixed OS network, I can say that this switch (which was an upgrade from a 5-port 10/100 hub) really improved my network connections.First off, you should know the difference between \"hubs\" and \"switches\".  Hubs are your typical central connecting device that will allow you to hook up more than one computer on to the network at a time.  They are usually quite cheaper than switches, at the price of loss of performance.  Switches have separate bandwidths for each port, unlike hubs; thus, allowing more traffic to go through between each computer on your network.  Of course, if you\\'re going to be doing nothing but sending e-mails and occasional web surfing, a cheap hub will do all of this for you.  But for the heavy gamers or those that want to use network intensive tools will appreciate the individual bandwidth that each port gets.Some people complain that by switching to this switch, their network performance has decreased.  This was the case with one of my computers, where transfer rates sharply fell from 42% capacity to 1.2% in a matter of seconds, rendering a 1GB file transfer practically impossible.  After a bit of analysis, I found 2 causes for this: 1) faulty cabling, and 2) cheap unreliable network adapter.  If you have cheap old network cables that have been crushed by chairs, doors, etc., they could be affecting the reliability of your network, and the full duplex operations of the 100Mbit network could be adversly affected by line conditions to where it has to resend packets to correct transmission errors.  The other common culprits are cheaply constructed network adapters (NIC\\'s) with especially poorly written drivers.  I replaced all wiring with 350MHz Cat 5e cabling and replaced all cheap cards (e.g., CNet Pro 200) with higher grade ones, and the reliability and transfer rates have soared to a little under theoretical maximum throughputs.  According to a network expert, some recommended lower-cost cards are D-Link DFE-530TX (uses the RTL 8139 chipset) or 3Com EtherLink or 905TX series.Too many people blame the switch when it is really their setup\\'s fault, and it should be pointed out that the switch is very well-made and easy to setup.  It should be pointed out that the switch does make an electric \"fuzz\" noise that many switches/hubs will generate.  If you are using quiet computers or laptops or are planning on putting the switch anywhere quiet, you might find the noise distracting.  However, it\\'s a subtle \"quiet\" sound, so the level may vary depending on your perception of loudness.  Also, if you have more than 8 computers, it should be noted that these switches are not stackable so you it won\\'t be as neat.  Wall mounting is possible and probably recommended, as a small, light-weight device such as this tends to not stay on the ground very well if the angles at which you plug in the network cables lifts or pulls on it.There aren\\'t any true flaws in the product, works and performs well, and I readily recommend it to anyone seeking to setup or improve a home network on a budget.',\n",

Other than that, this is a great bag and one that I feel safe carrying around my thousands (and thousands) of dollars worth of gear.For the price you can't go wrong!  The quality is great.  The safety for your items is top notch.\",\n",

Finally I started buying replacement pads at a wholesale telecom headset supplier online for $0.75 per pad, i could refurbish those headphones.  But now, the sliding portions of the headbands are breaking.After reading the reviews, I decided to buy 3x sets, one for a car DVD player, one for my backpack (use it with laptop, occasionally), and one for a spare.  They just arrived this morning and I could not be more delighted.These produce excellent bass and excellent high-frequency sound.  If there is any error in the frequency response, the midrange might be low by 1 dB or something, but that's just my first impression.  They are comfortable to wear and I am still trying them out, I can't believe my great luck.  For only $12, I got not just one headphone this time, but 3x headphones, with free shipping (I ordered other goods at the same time.)

       "  'reviewText': 'The Coby CX-CB12 portable radio is an analog multi-band radio that can be had for under $10.  At this price you can\\'t expect much, but the question is...is it worth spending any money on this radio?The radio itself comes in a nice box and it includes a set of ear buds.  The radio would be considered a large coat pocket size radio.  The overall feel is a bit better than what you would expect for such an inexpensive radio.  Instead of thumbwheels you actually have side-mounted knobs to turn which (in my opinion) are easier to use.  The front of the radio contains the speaker, the slide rule dial, a little tuning light and slide controls to turn the radio on (a nice feature) and to change the bands.  The analog dial features a little indicator that tells you what band you are tuning.  Unfortunately, the dial\\'s contrast is low making it difficult to see the numbers.The radio is powered by 2 AA batteries which should last a long time.  It was a tight squeeze to get the batteries in.  You also have a port for an adapter, but one is not provided.The earphone jack allows mono output through both stereo ear buds. The speaker provides reasonable \"pocket radio\" sound at a reasonable volume.  Sound is much better using headphones and actually is quite pleasant.Performance:LW:  The US doesn\\'t use long wave (except for some beacons) so I couldn\\'t test this.MW (AM) AM reception is OK.  I was able to tune Chicago stations with ease.  I was also able to tune strong out-of-state stations from many locations including 50 KW clear channel stations from Texas, Colorado, New York and Tennessee.  Selectivity was a bit below norm but OK.  Strangely, if the telescopic rod was extended, the radio would whine more and (toward 1600 KHz) it would actually pick up shortwave.SW:  The Coby provides a number of shortwave bands.  With the built in whip antenna it did a reasonable job of receiving international broadcasts.  Its simple single conversion design did results in images and some birdies and di-dah sounds, but they were not too objectionable.  I tried the radio with a short 10 foot wire attached to the whip antenna.  This overloaded the radio and I started to hear AM broadcasters on the shortwave.  Selectivity is OK for this type of set.  Shortwave would only be suitable for the big broadcasters like the BBC and Radio China but it did a reasonable job receiving those stations.FM:  At my office FM was fair.  However, my home is only a few miles away from a local FM station.  The station at 95.9 pretty much obliterated the lower portion of the FM dial.  I could get our town\\'s college station at 89.1 but not much else until WFMT at 98.7.  Shortening the antenna had no effect.  Based on this FM would only be acceptable if you were far away from any broadcasters.If the FM section worked better, the Coby would be a nice little radio, especially at $10.  No, it is not as good as a $50 dollar radio but at $10 it is in the disposable category and it could be used at the beach, camping or as a gift to a kid who has expressed an interest in radio.  With that said, the FM performance was so disappointing that it would be hard to recommend it.  A very good alternative is the jWin JX-M14 which can also be had for around for $10.  It doesn\\'t have quite the same frequency coverage but it does offer a digital readout, better FM and decent MW and SW performance.  The jWin handles a short wire antenna well, giving it the ability to pick up weaker stations.',\n",

Now there might be situations when you do not actually need the zoom capability and you rather looking a light lens that does add too much \"bulk\" to you camera body.  The 50mm lens from Canon is the lightest lens Canon offers for their SLRs.  The relative aperture of 1.8 is far lower than the one of my standard lens that starts somewhere in the 3-something range and goes up depending on the zoom applied.  So, 1.8 will give you far more flexibility when it comes to low light conditions.  I read tests where the 50mm f/1.8 scored even better than the 1.2 version, which costs about a 1,000 dollars more.  The tests also show that the aperture set to 4 brings the best results.  In summary:  This lens is amazing.  It is light and you get crystal clear shots.

First, the package was wrapped tight, don't get me wrong, that's just a way to evaulate the product based on my experience, which is the product inside wouldn't be good if the wrap were frigle.Second, there are 5,6 options of the earphone caps (sorry, i don't know how to say it right, but check the picture, you know what they are) offering different fits for ur ear.And then, i plugged it in my computer and watched the Transformers: The movie once again - i guess it was my 23rd time. and you know what, believe me, I DROPPED my coffee when the Optimus Primes's voice and the theme music kicked in. WOW~ Not bad for the earphone less than 100 bucks. well, to be honest, i should say i must put the earphone in a pretty good position otherwise it wouldn't be that shocking. IT IS NOT EASY to put them into ears correctly, get used to it. you'll be fine after 30 or 50 times practices. ^^Finally, i tried it on iPod (60G Black Video), and i got disappointed for the proformance.

But, then i tried play mp3 files on computer, and it sucked too. at last, i realize it is the format issue that mp3 couldn't hold so many datas encoded the wide range of sound, even the config is up to 320kbps... so, i set the itunes importing to Apple Lossless Encode and then ripped my CD collections again. The performance got WAY BETTER. but still, it can't be compared with the ones on CD player, even not comparable with the CD played on computer. I guess i'll have to buy a cd player then~Sum up, it was a wonderful choice. and I bought this one just before the price went down, paid 79.99 for this, but now it's just 50 something. so what'r u waiting for? i'm thinking about the best Shure, SE 530, right now. ^^ (please don't muck me about my itunes usage, rookie mistake, and i just thought my experience might help some other guys out there. Thanx.)\",\n",

Maybe one desperate day I'll pull it out and try to get it to work--when I have a feww hours to waste.It would have been nice cause I see the possibiilty of a second USB/wireless printer right next to the existing one within a year.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I came to these headphones after coming from $180 Shure E210 earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par, if not better, than them.  I loved my Shure earbuds and I love these a heck of a lot more.  The sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some, it's definitely not a deal breaker.  Personally, I appreciate the little extra bass these give.  It's not overwhelming, but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others.  There are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product:1) The adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as they're being removed.  Having short hair is beneficial with these headphones, but if you have long hair, simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently.  You'll have no problems otherwise.2) These headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type.  If this bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.  The sound leakage isn't super loud or annoying, but if you're in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level, a person a few feet from you will notice you're listening to music.Otherwise, the sound, the comfort, and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones.  They easily stand up to headphones within the $150-$200 price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price.  No, these are not too good to be true.  You won't be disappointed.\",\n",

For shame.The LEDs are pretty straight forward and it's easy to see at a glance which port is having activity. The unit is designed so that additional routers can stack and fit in an inter-locking fashion so that the legs of the unit above fit in indentations of the case below.

The soft and stretchy neoprene makes carrying a camera much more comfortable, though it does not slide so easily as other materials.  I could do without the quick release - it just adds clunkiness to the strap and though the quick-releases seem strong they could be a weak point?  The rest of the construction seems very well-made and I particularly like the way each camera attachment strap has two friction buckles - other straps I've had with only a single buckle have sometimes slipped and become detached.  So, streamline the thing doing away with the quick releases would earn five stars, but in the meantime it's four and I'm still looking!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Couldn't believe it...just 3 days after I got it and hooked it up, had a power surge: heard a small BLAT! come from this TrippLite as and the power went out in my room.  Went to check my in-wall circuit breaker and yep, it had flipped.  Went back to the Tripp-Lite, saw that both the green and the red lights were still on.  Touched it and noticed that it was quite warm in the area next to the power switch, so I decided to turn off the switch for a bit.  About 10 minutes later, turned it back on and confirmed that all the devices which were plugged into it (a laptop, 2 external hard drives, a powered USB hub, and a study lamp) still worked without a hitch.  So, two very impressive things: this thing not only did its job in protecting my equipment, AND it seems to have NOT been knocked out of action but also escaped unscathed!  (At least thus far...will update if anything worse happens subsequently.)Hallelujah!  I thank my lucky stars that I got this baby at just the right time...wonder what would've happened to my stuff if I'd continued using the cheap $13 generic power-strip/suppressor I'd bought off eBay.I have the Tripp-Lite Isobar protector for my home theater setup, but chose this model for my laptop because it claimed the same-ish (or maybe a little higher) Joule protection rating while saving me about twenty bucks...seems to have been a decent choice thus far!  The Isobar does feel a lot heavier and more substantial whereas this one is more plasticky looking/feeling, though it certainly isn't UGLY by any means...I actually prefer the dark gray-black color of the power cable and case over the white of the Isobar.\",\n",

They don't look &#34;as&#34; cheap as some in the same price class.Foam cushions are a little higher density than some, letting them sit closer to your ears.You won't care much if you break them or if they are stolen, except then you have no cans till you find a replacement.Cons:Lightweight - They have that empty tin can sound accentuating upper midrange, and they could have put a bit more plastic into the pieces that hold the cups only the adjustment sliders for more durabilityNo strain relief on the wires where they exit the cups.  If you coil your cord up for storage during portable use, you will find this to be one of the early failure modes.Clunky size adjustment, the notches in the HDPE rails are large and HDPE doesn't mold into distinct notches as well as other plasticsPre-molded angle on cups seems a little large compared to many cans, if your ears don't stick out a lot you may find they don't sit as flush against your ears as many cans despite the slight amount of swivel present, which results in loss of hearing much of the lower midrange and bassWhile the bass is fairly controlled for this price,  their marketing dept. fails with the feature &#34;XBS port&#34; because the bass is fairly poor relative to almost any (even slightly) larger cupped cans.  Small, light and portable is good but if you can accept an ounce of weight and a few millimeters size increase there are huge bass improvements to be had on cans with only slightly larger cups, and yet the price on those goes up some too.Although they are inexpensive, it would only cost a few cents more to make them more durable and improve the sound quality.  This seems like a false economy to me, my body and gear weigh dozens of pounds so why is shaving fractions of an ounce off their weight so important?  It isn't, this is just about saving a few cents in manufacturing cost at the expense of the aforementioned details.Overall:It's tempting to pick a product based on the lower price, but often you only get what you pay for.  Yes you could pay the same for inferior cans but don't let some of the more positive reviews fool you, these don't sound good at all relative to cans costly only a few dollar more.  They sound only slightly better than any $2 generic cans you can find anywhere.Despite all the pros I listed, they just don't meet the core purpose of providing good audio.  It is distracting how terrible they sound.  To be fair I would write the same about any $5 cans I've ever heard but on most I didn't see so many positive reviews that misled me into hoping these were different when they aren't.For a reference point, many consider me an audiophile.  My standards seem to be higher than average, but I'm not an elite snob about certain makes and models.  I've owned many a pair of cans and build some of my own audio gear and modify the rest.  Even so I am not trying to compare these against $40 cans, let alone more costly pairs.  They just don't sound good enough to use even if they were free, unless you're only listening to audible books or similar voice.  I would have returned them except that they are so inexpensive that it wasn't worth the bother.\",\n",

When viewing TV, I finally did get sound, but it wasn\\'t capturing the audio when I recorded.  Just remember that the to plug the adapter into the \"line out\" connection to the sound card.  Make sure that the \"installation wizard\" reflects that it is capturing to \"line out\" also.This card comes with everything.  All the cables for S-video, composite video, and audio cables.  But the best thing it comes with is the radio frequency remote control.  This baby does everything your universal remote can do.  And since it\\'s radio frequency and not infra red, you can virtually use it anywhere in your house.The package includes an interactive TV guide that you can program to when and what you want to record, crossword puzzles, and Video Studio 6 (which I have not used yet).I have read other reviews on this product and most people will have difficulty with the installation.  When I installed the card, I went to ATI.com to update the drivers.  When I did, everything went to hell, so I did a system restore to get me back before I installed.  I\\'ll keep the drivers that came with the disk, thank you.This All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 just blows my mind!!  I think its about the best $130 I ever spent.

       "  'reviewText': \"Well, I've now had my Tungsten T for about 3 months.  Hope the following points help you decide.applications:  I love them all!  I thought I would install lots of apps once I got the device, but after using it, I didn't see the need.  The apps that come with the base Palm OS are simple yet completely satisfy my needs.  I got rid of so many pieces of paper lying around our home-office, various files, emails, ... and put them on the pda.  It then synchronizes with the computer to have access and backup.  I use the Palm Desktop tool (bundled in), not the MS Outlook hookup.  I'm not a pro-Outlook person.battery life: I use my palm a lot.  My wife thinks it's a bit silly to use it everywhere.  I have to get her one now - seriously!  That would be perfect with bluetooth.  Getting back to the battery.  I use the palm all weekend and charge it when I get back to work on Monday - that's where the cradle is.  By that point, it's little more than half full.  So, I would assume it lasts 4 or 5 days of very heavy usage. Over normal weekends, I don't see the charge indicator change at all.  I do know that if the battery drains, then the data is safe for about a week.buttons: It's kind of convenient to have the audio recorder button right there on the side,  if only I used it.  The power button, I feel, is awkwardly located on top of the device, forcing me to hold the pda up before using it - otherwize I'd only be pushing it around.  The recorder button is right next to the power button, right where I put my fingers to hold the PDA when I turn it on - it's not a natural holding position for me.  If I put the pda in my pocket, or jacket, I often find it turned on when I pull it out because of where the buttons are.  I think a better idea would have been to place the buttons on the front panel. The device comes with a protective cover that would protect those buttons, had they been located on top face, like I'm suggesting.screen: I was concerned that it would scratch easily with the pen.  I was wrong.  It did, however, get scratched in my jacket pocket with my keys.  I was almost crying when I saw it, but it still works just fine.mp3: Real has released an mp3 player for Tungsten, but you must have a memory card (extra) with the device to use it.  You cannot store music files on the system memory.camera: I got the Veo camera with the pda.  It takes 'ok' pictures at 320x240 or 640x480.  You just can't move, or the picture will be fuzzy.  I've taken pictures of my kids.  That way, I can admire them anytime!  The camera weight in a little more then a peanut.  It's just incredible.  The manual focus is a bit of a pain.bluetooth: I haven't used it yet.  There are bluetooth access points out there, but I'm not sure how that would work.  From what I understand, you must have a bluetooth phone to use the web browser.I've accidently dropped it 3 times on hard surface so far, mostly from hip height level - if only it had a little parachute!  Nothing yet - but I wouldn't try it on purpose.Compared to Dell Axim: a friend has an Axim, which is substantially less money, a product that competes well with the Tungsten.  I know he likes his pda, but he rarely uses it because it's bigger.  Ok, it's not that much bigger, but it does make a difference if you put it in your pocket.  Imagine having a bigger wallet, but only that you cannot sit on it!  Where are you going to put it?All in all, after thinking I would never get a PDA, I now wouldn't get rid of it.\",\n",

I had read through many reviews before purchasing these headphones as there are many varying options in this price range.  These seemed to be the best fit for overall value/quality.  I'm unhappy with the overall sound quality as sometimes they make files sound grainy as if the file is of low fidelity.  I've tried them with different devices and they have this issue across all of them.  I also thought possibly that it was the quality of the files that were causing the issues,  so I then cross referenced the files by listening in different bit/rates and different file types.  It was not the file type that mattered.  They are ill equipped at handling very deep bass that I had previously come to know with a competitors headphones. This problem wasn't limited to music files either.  For movies, it seems the same issues occur.  The deeper notes lose their crispness and it's distracting.  The build quality seems good, I've had no problems in this area.  The fit and function work well also.  Perhaps I just got a bad example of this product,  but overall,  I would recommend buyers look elsewhere in this price range.I would not recommend this product to others.\",\n",

Mine worked well until the first set of batteries were down, exactly five days after my Amazon deadline to return it! The sensor and receiver lights still come on but the alarm no longer works making it useless! Mine worked well as a motion alarm until the sound quit. This is not a quality made product. I\\'m going to try the more expensive one made by another company.I call this motion sensor system a limited good value buy due to its downfalls that despite the low price will be a deal breaker for many people. I\\'m a gadget guy and I\\'m budget minded in that I practice money management. I let go of my money at least as hard as it is to get it.To save a penny or two, someone (not \"they\" or the \"company\") decided to broaden acceptable manufacturing specs such that the motion sensor is enough out of round on both ends that a light wind will cause it to rotate and set off the Chimes.To hype sensor sensitivity or save a penny by using the most common off the shelf 180 degree sensor, usefulness is  reduced.I\\'ve been experimenting with this unit since I got it to see what exactly I can do with it. People can walk across my driveway on the sidewalk & not activate the chime but a car, SUV.or truck passing by the same way on the street sets it off every time.What many people want is a more focused sensor like mall stores had to compensate for having a wide open door way. More like an light beam straight line that chimes when something passes through. Like it is with hearing aids, the sensor industry has not kept up with the digital revolution. The Chinese have a less MBA notion of profit. Guess I\\'ll have to search Chinese retailers for the inexpensive, low energy, feature rich security sensor  digital revolution technology makes possible.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'As expected, the Domke F-1x follows the same tradition of quality design manufacturing and simplicity as other Domke bags. Having owned a variety of camera bags from manufacturers such as LowePro, Tenba, Tamrac, Timbuk 2, Opteka, and others, I am familiar with many design and manufacturing aspects affecting practical usability and wear in the field. Throughout the years, Domke took many of these issues into consideration.The F-1x, as it\\'s extended name implies, is a \"Little Bit Bigger Bag.\"  I specifically compare the F-1x to theDomke 700-02A F-2 Bag (Brown Waxwear Finish)and it is in fact a \"Little Bit Bigger.\" However, in my opinion, it still maintains the nearly same sleek design as the F-2.  It does not feel or look bulky, but it sure carries more gear.  The construction of the bag is near military specs in my opinion. Heavy duty stitching, quality workmanship, heavy canvas, strong hardware, etc...  This bag, as many people report of other Domke bags, will last many years under the roughest conditions.  The strap, in my opinion, does not need any padding because it is wide enough. Some might still prefer to use aDomke 725-310 FA-031 U.S. Post Office Shoulder Pad, which I actually own but rarely use.  The underside of the strap provides some type of rubber grip that will keep it from sliding and it does a good job.The genius of Domke bags is the streamline approach (simplicity) and limited padding.  This helps the bag avoid becoming cumbersome like theLowepro Stealth Reporter D400 AW Camera Bag. However, it is a tradeoff in gear protection and bag structure. Since the bag is canvas and with limited internal padding, when empty, the bag loses it\\'s structure.  But really, who cares? And while Domke does provide theDomke 720-240 FA-240 4 Compartment Insert (Green), it\\'s flexibility, size, and protection leave a lot to be desired. In fact, I replaced it with theCiesta Flexible Camera Insert Partition for DSLR SLR Lens (Brown / Large), which I found better suited for my partcular needs.  The Ciesta insert also provides better weather and dust protection since the F-1x does not come with a raincover.The bag provides a very large main compartment, two front pockets (flapped), two side pockets (flapped), and a magazine pocket backside.  The external pockets allow you to load them with a large amount or gear.What\\'s in my bag today:-Nikon D300s w/ grip-Nikon D7000 w/o grip-4 Nikon prime lenses-Tokina 12-24-2 Nikon SB-900\\'s-2 Pocket Wizards (in a Nikon case)-2 LensPens-Moleskine and pen-Small Giottos Rocket blower-Lowepro Memory Card Wallet-8 AA batteries (in 2xStoracell by PowerPax SlimLine 4 AA Battery Caddy Yellow - Holds 4 \"AA\" Batteries)-Camera Strap-Iphone-Grey card-Small reflector-Lumiquest BounceBesides being able to hold a ton of gear, the bag actually feels good to carry AND it does not scream \"camera bag!\" on first or even second glance. It is subtle and professional. The selection of a camera bag is a highly personal and studied task by most photographers. In my case, moving to the Domke F-1x and F-2 is more evolutionary than revolutionary. I eventually found my Lowepro bags were incredibly bulky and overly padded for carrying downtown, though they protect the equipment perhaps like no other. Now, I simply use the F-2 for street shooting and quick moving scenarios, the F-1x when I have to bring more gear for a generally static or slow moving situation, the F-1x or F-2 and theDomke Rolling Propack 220 Camera Bag - Blackwhen I have to bring all my gear to a static location shoot. My lighting gear (stands, umbrellas, grip, etc.) is all carried in a duffle type roller and only brought to static locations.As a side note, a cheaper alternative to this bag for some may be theOpteka Excursion Series C900 Full-Size Weatherproof Canvas Bag for Photo and Video Cameras, which is similar in design and possibly even bigger (I do not own it). And, for those concerned with the open (to the elements) aspect of the F-1x main compartment, the Opteka addresses this concern with an internal flap, under the main flap, that zips shut.',\n",

It is faster at lifting the handset than the Plantronics units I have used which is nice. It installs easily, and has both a built in mic, and an external mic that you can hook up to alert you when the phone rings. The sensitivity of this mic is also adjustable with a built in dial. I have used this lifter on Nortel M2008, M2016, Cisco 7941, and 7961 phones with no problems.My only complaint is the durability of the unit. I have broken 2 in 3 years, the first by accidently holding the handset down when it was trying to lift. The second time it just wore out. What happens is after a failure, when you try to use it you get a bad clicking noise. What happens is that there is a threaded shaft attached to the electronic motor which breaks loose. It is attached only with some kind of glue that can't handle any kind of torque. I was able to fix it with some super glue and it has been working for a few weeks. One nice thing is that it doesn't seem to fail partially, when it breaks it breaks for good. So you aren't left wondering if the unit will work when you press the button.Overall I have been happy with this lifter. I have ordered and installed this unit many time in my Enterprise.

This Grundig brings a lot of features to the table such as digital tuning, forty presets, great capture of stations and above average sound. I've really enjoyed using the 400 and its great features.One complaint I had was that the manual that accompanies it does an inadequate job of explaining some of the functions and the pre-sets are all inclusive, that is it's forty pre-sets for all bands FM/SW/LW/MW rather than per band. But these are small things that shouldn't take away from the overall excellence of the radio.I'm getting ready to go on an extended trip to the third world and the Grundig YB 400PE is at the top of my packing list.\",\n",

The circuit board is almost as big as half the size of the surge protector. I have no doubt that this is the best surge protector that can be bought for the price. I plan to buy another one for my home entertainment system. My home has had mysterious electronics damage where multiple appliances have been broken at the same time. My DVR, Microwave Control, and Oven Electronic control all were fried within a few days of each other so I know I need to add protection.

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought this device expecting to receive the same service I would have received if I had bought it in a store. The CD does not contain a driver for Vista, and the computer wouldn\\'t recognize the device. I called customer service for help, and I was told that the warranty expired already on the device even though it was new and had never been used. Beware of buying this from an online retailer other than a big-box company, or you won\\'t be able to get tech support.It took me about three hours of research to determine the driver I needed (version 1.0). If you are a 32-bit Vista system, you can use this device. If you are a 64-bit, forget it. I did manage to finally download the driver. DO NOT INSTALL THE PCI CARD UNTIL YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE DRIVER! I ended up having to uninstall the device and driver I should not have installed and to restart my computer 6 times during the three hour period. I got frustrated and was very short with the tech person, who was \"very sorry\" about all my difficulties, but could do nothing to help me unless I wanted to purchase another device from her over the phone and upgrade.Linksys clearly will not stand by their product if you haven\\'t bought it from the right retailer. The web page was not very helpful, and I got better advice from independent forums than from the Linksys site.That said, now that the device is installed, it is working beautifully. It is about thirty feet from the computer and I had no difficulty streaming Hulu. The wireless is connected to a 54G router, and it\\'s plenty fast enough. If you are an average browser of the Internet, you do not need an N or N+, and I recommend that you do not spend the extra money on the router or wireless.To update: This has now been working perfectly for over two years. I got slammed in a comment for being a dunce about discovering what I needed to do - this was my first experience with installing wireless, and this particular piece of equipment was the only piece I had trouble with. I had no issue with the product, or even with having to struggle a little to get it to work; my issue was with the lack of available service from Linksys for a new product from the company, and a lack of instructions in the product itself. And it is still working beautifully - even with the Vista operating system.',\n",

Fix broken and add new functionality.- OOG Vorbis support- More than loud enough- Equalizer (preset and user-set)- No need for drivers, just plug it in and see it as another drive.- Leather case- Comes with every cable needed (except for Optical recording).  External mic, Stereo hookup, USB, headphones and so forth.- Lyrics can be shown in the display- Text-file support- Boot-time is only 12 seconds (I know others have mentioned 3-4 minutes, something must be wrong with their player)-  Plenty of 3rd party support and forums (search Iriver and forum in Google).With such a great product there has to be a couple of snafu's.- Since the IRiver does not have a clock, it does not have a real random function either, and this manifests itself by starting with the same song every time it has been disconnected.  This could easily be solved through the upgradeable firmware so I do expect to see an update.- No delete support from the player.  Would be nice if you could just delete a file right on the player.Both of these minor problems could be solved with firmware upgrades so I am not worried.This is the player to get...

Powers on now and even provides some limited intermittent function between two computers connected to it but wont talk to the route and will not connect to the net which tells me the up-link port is completely shot and the other ports are about done for. Warranty is for all practical intents and purposes pointless as the customer is expected to pay for shipping both ways and in the end you have a refurbished unit that only carries the original purchase date warranty (i.e. in my case warranty would end on 7/7/2015 with the 5 year warranty this model has) but shipping cost more than buying a new product. I am dropping my review to 2 stars since it did when all is said and done last 20 months which comes out to $1.20 a month at the price I paid and $1 a month at the current price. Final verdict, I will consider getting another one to replace this but only if I can't find one with a better warranty plan for about the same price.See original review below...There isn't really much to say about a switch, it has one simple job and as long as it does it that's what counts (A switch for those who are not certain is easiest to explain by saying it is akin to a power strip, you can plug all the machines you want into to it, but if you don't plug it into a managed source of signal such as a router or server it is like expecting a surge strip to provide power and work when it is not plugged into an AC outlet). If you want to split one LAN Drop (Network plug in) at for example at your entertainment center and hook up your PS3, Cable/Satellite box, Internet ready TV, A/V receiver with internet radio, etc. This is for you because all a switch does is take the one IP address assigned to it by the host system and share it out over all devices connected to it (while they are turned on and seeking connection of course, it doesn't allot bandwidth to devices that are not currently asking for any).Bottom line is this does the job so far and is well constructed, at this very moment unit has been plugged in for almost two weeks and is cool to the touch (I have it wall mounted behind my TV were it gets plenty of airflow) so time will tell but I have seen units like this in multiple brands at customer sites (I'm a network tech) work for years, if this one fails in an abnormally short time I will revise my review to reflect the time and details/circumstances of the failure.\",\n",

I found in using the increased bandwidth of the Monster splitters of 2Ghz having improved the sharpness of analog and digital cable TV reception. Additionally, as more people are opting for HDTV sets and broadband internet connectivity, reducing signal loss will provide one potential improvement relating to multiple connections. Other issues relate to dirty AC power interference and the quality of the cabling used, (such as superior performance in S-Video or composite cables), so the solution to maximize your signal quality is multifaceted. It is recommended to use either the 2 or 3 splitter variation. The 4-splitter model has more signal loss.

The Canons have a fine reputation for durability and if ever there is a problem, service has been excellent. The A40 in the entry model in a series of sturdy digicams that offer progressively higher resolutions, but little else in terms of functionality. As I have stated in numerous reviews of other digicams, resolution much beyond 2 megapixels is worse than useless for *most* applications, it is costly. It not only costs money in the sense that it raises the initial price of the camera, but operationally, it requires greater battery use, usually involves longer lag times between shots, takes much longer to download to a PC and especially prolongs both phases of e-mailing photos (your uploading the file and your recipient opening it). These latter issues are, in my opinion, the most important, as the real purpose of digital cameras is their neat integration into the world of personal computing.  [note: For those folks whose needs are enlarging photos beyond 8\" x 10\", higher resolution is required] The other features of the A40 worth noting are its very adequate 3X optical zoom (do not accept digital zooms in place of optical zooms; they are not equals), its ability to operate off readily available AA alkalines (though it will accept rechargeables and these make more sense in may ways), its easily expandable memory and its rather surprising number of user-controllable settings, all of which can be handled automatically if you prefer.

These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don\\'t look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don\\'t look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn\\'t think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they\\'re a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won\\'t even give looks a second thought after you put them on.One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not \"boomy\"), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without \"bass booster\" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I\\'m not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you\\'re listening to if you have the volume up loud).Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the \"Light\" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn\\'t something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won\\'t end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.While I wouldn\\'t say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don\\'t fold down as small as you might think they would so don\\'t expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.I can\\'t say enough good things about these PortaPros! They\\'re simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I\\'ve had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&amp;B to Country and everything in-between. I\\'ve been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer! If you\\'re like me you\\'ll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones (haha! how often is that said?) years ago...',\n",

I use an mp3 player for exercise and I definitely have had a problem with the earbuds coming out, mostly when I run and skip rope.I found that I was constantly adjusting the headphones in my ears and I had a lot more attention on them falling out than when I used my other earbuds. When I put my mp3 player and the cord for the headphones under my shirt (my usual custom to help prevent wires jumping about all over the place, these were pulled out of my ears a couple times. When I kept the mp3 player under my shirt and ran the cord down the bottom of my shirt and up the outside it was much better and they weren't pulled out again.Part of the problem may be that my ears are a bit curled out, but do take this into account - not all ears are the same!The sound quality is okay, but not great.I will continue using them as I've worn out my other headphones and these aren't terrible, but if I'd had a chance to try them out before purchasing, I wouldn't.\",\n",

I had previous owned a Minolta S404, and I have been much happier with the Powershot for the following reasons:1. The autofocus mechanism is much more reliable than the Minolta S404 in my experience. This probably has something to do with the autofocus assist lamp. Even in bright outdoor scenes, the Powershot seems to do a better job.2. Less noise in low light situation than the Minolta S404. None of the flash photos that I've taken with this camera have shown signficant color noise problems like what I saw in the Minolta.3. Very short time between frames. When you turn off the LCD preview, you can shoot images back to back in under 2 seconds. The Minolta would pause nearly 4-5 seconds in most cases.4. It is actually compact enough to be easily portable. Don't fool yourself into thinking that one of the medium sized cameras (Minolta S404, Canon G3/G4/G5) will give you all the control you loved about your old 35mm SLR camera. They don't come close. To make matters worse, they are also no more portable than a full-size SLR. So in one sense, they are the worst of both worlds: too bulky to fit in a pocket, but not geeky enough to make real photo geeks happy. The Powershot is a good compromise in that you give up some manual features and interchangeable lenses, but you have a camera that will literally fit in your pocket.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Unit Failure:I tried everything, and I could only get one of the two USB ports to function. Tried mouse, keyboard, flash card reader... everything worked on side one; nothing on side two. Strange thing is that they all got power -- the mouse lit up, the flash card reader lit up -- but weren\\'t recognized. Attempted on second workstation with same results. Not sure if this is a defective unit or just bad design.Design Flaw:The only way to switch between computers is a keyboard \"hot key\" combination. However, I COULD NOT GET ANY COMBINATION TO WORK. I tried everything in the book, and nothing would switch computers. I could type fine; the unit simply refused to recognize any attempt to switch. I have no idea if this is an issue with my keyboard or the switch.Functional Quirks:Even with the side that worked, I noticed irregularities. When I first plugged-in my mouse, my PC didn\\'t see any changes. Even after a restart, nothing. On a whim, I unplugged the mouse from the switch and inserted into Computer, which the PC immediately recognized. I then unplugged/plugged into switch, and the PC recognized it this time with the switch. Same behavior with the keyboard. Experience was not consistent, i.e. I restarted several times afterward and it seemed to be ok.Summary:1. Due to the design flaw (keyboard switching), I was not able to successfully switch between computers; and, thus, could not confirm the unit would switch between PC and Mac.2. Due to the product flaw (bad switch), I was simultaneously able to use a keyboard or a mouse, but not both at the same time.3. Due to the irregularities of the one working USB port, I do not have sufficient faith in this unit to exchange for another one. The last thing I want is to spend two weeks getting a replacement only to have plug the mouse in and out of the PC periodically to get it to work.Recommendation:I do not recommend this unit or this vendor under any circumstances. Find a unit with a hard button switch to prevent any keyboard \"hot key\" incompatibility. You obviously get what you pay for.

       "  'reviewText': \"Now, consider first the price: I paid about $100 for mine, with the going rate right now at about $120. This is not a professional lens, by any stretch... but it is one of the best lenses you can purchase as a beginning photographer!I have had this lens for about 4-5 months right now, and it has barely been off my camera! The aperture allows for very low-light photography, and the glass is good quality for the price you pay.The lens construction is plastic, but unless you are particularly rough on your equipment, you shouldn't have a problem. The focusing ring is small, but I rarely use manual focus because most of my photos are of action shots.Speaking of action shots, that's where this lens shines. I take photos of one of the local show choirs pretty often, and the environment in their shows isn't exactly conducive to photography. Lighting is very variable; sometimes the light is good, but other times there's a spotlight on one or two people with limited light on the rest. That makes for some demanding choices- do you go with a high ISO and/or aperture and try to get a good shot of everyone, or do you just try to get the people in the spotlight? With this lens, you can open up the aperture much wider than a kit lens, which means that you don't have to raise the ISO. That's good if you want to reduce noise in the photos. I can shoot 800 or 1600 ISO with a wide aperture and still stop the motion of the dancers.There are a few weaknesses, though. This is a prime lens- no variable zoom, which means that your zoom is all leg-zoom. I've gotten very good at moving around for my photography because of this, so unless you simply cannot move, this isn't really a weakness. The lens does sometimes focus slowly, and with a narrow manual focus ring it isn't easy to keep focused. It also isn't great for macro shots- the minimum focus distance is somewhere around 1.5 feet, so the kit lens is better in that one circumstance.Pros:InexpensiveHigh quality for the priceLarge apertureLightweightCons:Plastic construction (lightens the lens, but less durability)No zoom (not a Con for me, but for some it might be)Small focus ringSometimes slow to focusLong minimum focus length\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have bilateral Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and have had both hands surgically repaired within the last year. I do application design work and need to have very fine control over the position of the pointer. Not wanting to have a regression in symptoms, and looking for the most comfortable pointing device that allows me to work without moving my wrist, I've tried several different trackballs. I have bought theKensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball for PC or Mac 64325, the Logitech Trackman Wheel, and this Logitech Optical Marble Mouse. The Expert Mouse was very well built and included a nice wrist rest, but it was a bit too large even for my large hand. I still had to move my wrist around in order to move the ball and press the buttons. I used it for two weeks before giving up on it. The Logitech Trackman's ball is manipulated by using the thumb only, and I found myself straining in order to hold the ball steady while clicking the mouse buttons. The main issue here is my own limitations rather than a design flaw on the mouse. Due to the nerve damage I suffered in my right hand, I can't hold my thumb steady enough to use this mouse.The Logitech Marble Mouse is perfect for my needs. The design is the most comfortable I have tried and I am able to move the ball using my index and middle fingers while letting my thumb and ring finger rest comfortably on the left and right buttons. An added bonus for me is that the buttons are not as sensitive as most others I have used. This allows me to relax my hand and let the fingers rest on the buttons without inadvertently clicking. I am able to comfortably work with this mouse without moving my wrist at all. There are two additional programmable buttons that are well-placed so that I don't accidentally click them, but they are handy when needed. The mouse is well built and has a nice heft to it. The rubberized areas underneath keep it from wandering across my desk.I highly recommend this product to anyone who either suffers from CTS or wants to avoid developing it in the future.I'm updating this review (1/14/2009) now that I have had this device for some time.My CP did begin to flare up again, and I have finally settled on a solution. I removed the ball from this trackball, and use it with my right hand only to click. I then gutted a regular mouse to disable the buttons (so I could relax my hand and let it rest over the mouse) and use it with my left to move the cursor. Yes, mousing is now a two-handed operation, but it is the only way I can avoid the damage to my wrists. Ideally, I would love to have a flat touch pad for my left instead of the mouse, but I haven't found one yet.\",\n",

My budget was tight and I got lucky and escaped the mono models when Officexxxxx had it for $99 after $100 rebate.(Tip: just scan Sunday's sales flyers on Saturday and save)The Tungesten E was it. The unit is slim, shinny, attractive and it screams for attention right out of the box. The Screen is awesome with 320x320 TFT vivid colors. 3 months have gone by, and the unit is rock solid performance and uptime. I only had to soft reset the unit few time and it was due to my file mismanagement and had never had a data loss.What do you do next? Upload the installation CD, and HotSync and Bingo. Used for what? A lot. Keep contacts, phone numbers, addresses, flight information, conversion, dictionary, calculator, maps, photo album, video, MP3, e-books, basic Excel and Word document, emails, and of course Games. There are tons of open source and free applications, databases, and utilities on the Web, just browse, install and test them one at a time.An external SD card is almost a must; I got the excellent Kingston Elite 512-S and have most of the graphic applications, MP3 files and games on it.My only complains are, the processor is a bit slow but adequate, the unit will not accept a WI-FI upgrade, and that the battery is fixed (not a user-accessible).If you're looking for beautiful screen, clean interface, ease of use, and on a budget, go for the E.\",\n",

I recommend just hooking this device up to your Windows XP machine and letting the pre-installed XP (Home Edition) driver do the work.

       "  'reviewText': \"Whenever I buy a portable CD player, I immediately rip into the package, check out what all the new features I've acquired are, and then I give the headphones away. Why? Because newer style players have all gone the same way the old styles have, with the over-the-ear styles that look more like earmuffs than headphones. Perhaps they enclose the ear in a different manner than in the past, imprisoning it in a different method, but the results are always the same. They convolute the sound, pushing the volume onto the ear but muffling the symphonies that are made. Personally I like to listen to all the sounds within my music, wanting what I paid for, and this is bothersome. In fact, I'd go play records with my grandmother if I wanted to hear a slightly distorted sound. See, I want to hear every synth in the EBM and I want to taste every flavor in the voxing of those voices. So, I go and buy myself a pair of MDRW24V's and I'm set.There are a few reasons I SWEAR by this design, and one of the more prominent ones (besides the in-the-ear design) is the volume control. The reason I like it is because it: (1) gives me an easy way to turn the player up when I'm too lazy to reach for the remote (2) gives me a back-up in case I break the remote or I accidentally get my player stuck on &quot;hold&quot; and I'm too busy to fish out the player or (3) because it allows me to override the sound restrictions that are there to safeguard my hearing on my discman and to make it louder. All of these work wonders, too, because I'm really not prone to listening to the noises that are manufactured by my fellow human beings. I'd rather drown out the Muzak when walking through the mall and I'd rather have an override switch that turns up the volume quickly if I'm approached by people I don't want to hear. Taking this and coupling it with an in-the-ear design works wonders, too.Besides that, they are durable, they don't blow out all that often, and you should honestly replace your headphones AT LEAST once a month anyhow - and more if you use them like I do. During the time that you own them, you shouldn't have to worry about durability issues, about its ability to carry sound, and you also shouldn't have to worry about something newly designed that looks nice but that hurt when you wrap it around your ears. Here you have the answers to all your listening needs because Sony products last!\",\n",

It got to the point where I'd more often than not reach for my HD203s (I'm not a Sennheiser nut, I just liked the 203s so much I splurged for these).Rearranging my workspace has allowed me to place the base away from whatever was causing the interference (most likely a speaker) and now these things rock me so hard.

I should have ordered it from Amazon when I got home and $aved!Lowe's products are always very well made, and I loved my Slingshot 202AW bag so much, when my system outgrew it, I bought a 302AW.  In that the DMC-Z is no exception -- while small, it is well padded and just feels sturdy in your hand.  The pockets are not open mesh, even if they look like it in the photos; they are some kind of slck, soft plastic, so the cards' corners won't catch.I have an issue with the DMC-Z.  First, it WILL hold up to six CompactFlash cards in its pockets, along with my reader device.  It can only hold four CF cars in their cases, however, and you can barely close it if you try, due to the additional thickness of the flip cases.  Without the cases -- I don't need them in this tight closing case, and I'm not planning to visit Afghanistan soon -- I fit all six of my CF cards, plus my ExpressCard reader device (MUCH faster than any USB 2.0 device).  Zipping the case takes a little effort, but it will close with the seven devices in place.  That's just a little too snug for me -- I'm concerned about the stresses on the DMC-Z.  I think a minor redesign would improve the fit a little, but I don't know if Lowe will bother.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'About a year ago, I switched from a commute by car to a commute via train and subway (from New Jersey to New York).  I am an audiophile, so I wanted a good-sounding CD player/headphone combo.  And since I damaged my hearing years ago with a Walkman that I played too loud (causing Tinnitus), I wanted as much noise isolation as possible.  For various reasons, in-the-ear-canal ear buds don\\'t work for me, so I set out to find a good pair of on or over the ear cans that offered good fidelity and a reduction in exterior noise.  Note:  I don\\'t do reduced bit rates, so all of the comments refer to performance using standard \"Red Book\" CDs.Although I started out with an iRiver CD player (which is a pretty good-sounding player), it was too picky about the CDs it would read, so I switched to the Sony D-NE320PSBLK Psyc player.  This player reads almost all CDs, sounds OK, although the treble is somewhat rolled-off (but I actually prefer this when listening to headphones; it compensates for overly-bright CDs).  It has great battery life and great features.First, I tried the Sennheiser PXC-250, an on-ear portable design.  Although neutral sounding, the Senns lacked good bass extension.  Worse, the out-board noise cancelling module created a mess of tangled wires.  After only three months of daily use, the wires went, and since everything is hard-wired, the Senns were now useless (quite a difference from my home headphones, Sennheiser 424X I bought new in 1976 and still work perfectly).Next, I tried the Aiwa HP CN6.  This is an open-air, on-the-ear design with electronic noise cancelling.  The noise cancelling works well, and these cans sound fairly good.  A little bright, but with extended, powerful bass and fairly neutral mids.  The noise cancellation circuit increases efficiency to 106 dB, one of the highest efficiency ratings for noise-cancelling phones.  This saves battery power on your player.  However, the circuitry adds a significant amount of hiss.  Battery life of the Aiwas was fantastic.  Comfort-wise, they were only fair, and the thin foam earpads were beginning to wear out after about six months of use.  Then, the noise cancelling function stopped working.  Time to look again.I visited the Bose Store with my player and tried the $300 Bose cans.  The sound was OK, but not what you\\'d expect for the price.  The electronic noise cancellation seemed to work well, with less added hiss, but the passive noise cancellation from the sealed, over-the-ear design was poor.  I could clearly hear the Bose salesman talking on the phone a few feet away, almost as loudly as without the headphones.  Plus, it was much less efficient than the Aiwas, which would have meant heavy battery use in my player (which takes only one AA battery).  Just not worth the money (like most Bose products, IMO).Then I tried two Koss noise cancelling models.  The QZ-50 is an inexpensive, behind-the-neck, over-the-ear design.  It was aweful.  It\\'s electronic noise cancellation added hiss but no apparent noise reduction at all.  It\\'s passive noise reduction was inneffective as well, since the ear pieces did not make a tight seal over the ears.  And it was very innefficient, making it a poor choice for portable players.  The newer QZPro was on sale on line, so I tried it as well.  This padded over-the-ear design is comfortable, but passive noise cancellation was minimal.  Active noise cancellation was OK, with some added hiss, but it was the least effecient design (90 db!) I have seen.  Sound quality was fair, but I preferred the Aiwas, and I was ready to buy a new pair of them when I started reading about the JVC HANC100 phones.Feature-wise, the HANC100 is nice.  Unless you have larger-than-average ears, they are comfortable.  The headband bothering so many hasn\\'t bothered me yet.  The ear cups fit over my ears, although I do have to partially fold my outer ear into them.  They seem sturdy, although the cord is thin and I have gotten it caught on things a few times, without causing damage.  I do not retract the cord, since I cary them inside a duffle bag when not in use.  The only issue I have with comfort is that they are warm.  In February, they double as good ear muffs, but I fear that in warmer weather they will make my ears sweat.  After an hour or so, I do feel the need to shift them to relieve pressure on my eyeglass side-pieces.  These comfort issues are half the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.  Like all of these electronic noise cancelling cans, you can\\'t use the noise reduction feature in windy conditions, since the wind noise through the built-in mics is too loud.  But at least you can shut that function off on the JVCs, and listen without it.Efficiency-wise, the HANC100 is fine.  Not quite as effecient as the Aiwas, but I suspect that the published spec of 103 dB with noise cancelling off and 100dB with noise cancelling on, is innaccurate.  First, it\\'s the only time I\\'ve seen a *decrease* in efficiency with the noise reduction on.  Second, I hear no difference in level whether it\\'s switched on or off.Sound-wise, they are OK.  They would benefit from a less resonant enclosure, since there is a little of the \"cupped-hand\" effect in the mid-band.  I adapted to that quickly, though, and overall, they sound clean and neutral.  Bass is a bit muddy and does not extend too deep, but the Sony player has numerous bass-boost features that compensate for this.  When a CD is bass-heavy, the JVCs respond well to a point, but can be overloaded with extremely high levels of bass, and they then distort audibly.  The highs are noticeably rolled-off, but I prefer this for headphones.I have had no issues with uneven channel level.One thing to be aware of is that they are not shielded from cell-phone interferance, and you will here buzzing (like an old morse code device) when cell phones are in use nearby.  I can live with this, although I hear that Sony has added shielding to its noise cancelling phones.  How about it, JVC?Now the best part:  The noise cancellation.  Passive noise cancellation, which covers higher frequencies, is excellent.  With all the other cans I tried, I used to hear conversation of other passengers clearly.  With the HANC100, I can tell people are speaking, but at levels reduced so much that I can\\'t tell what they\\'re saying - awesome!  They only thing they don\\'t block out is the elevator music that the Port Authority plays - at fairly high volume - in its larger train stations.The electronic noise cancellation is also quite good.  If you commute by train or subway, then you know how loud trains and subways can be, both from outside and inside.  With the HANC100, I can barely tell when a train car end-door has been opened while the train is moving.  With other headphones, this made listening impossible.  And the rumbling of the trains is almost completely eliminated when inside the train.  Outside, the trains are very loud.  While the HANC100 doesn\\'t block enough of that noise to listen through it, it does reduce the noise significantly, and that\\'s a good thing for my ears.The one star was deducted for comfort, although I doubt they could be made cooler (with ventilation) without loosing some of the passive noise reduction, and for the lack of cell-phone shielding.The HANC100 would be a good value at its list price of ~$90.  At street prices, which are much lower (check Amazon\\'s price!), they are an outright steal!  I recommend the HANC100 over any other noise cancelling headphones I\\'ve tried.EDIT (3/13/06): After a few weeks, and some unintended tugging at the cord, the right earcup developed a crackling sound which modulates both with the audio signal and amount of external noise.  Sounds like something is loose within the earcup.  I have ordered a second pair.  If these last about a year, fine -  can live with replacing them no more often than once per year.  If not, I will have to look at something else.  Oh, well.EDIT (7/10/07):  The second pair lasted well over a year.  Even then, they failed because the wire got snagged on something, and frayed.  So, this is due to being damaged by me, not because they failed with normal use.  They still work, but the left channel sometimes cuts out.  Overall, I have enjoyed these \\'phones, and I will replace them with another pair.  Strongly recommended.',\n",

And I've got a new beef:  Due to the small size of the camera,  it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the LCD screen.

       "  'reviewText': \"After an intense gaming experience using a regular mouse, I was nearly crippled from the resulting pain and had to find an alternative. I'd had shoulder surgery and although I was recovering nicely, apparently still had weaker muscles than I realized because the next day I couldn't move my arm at all.  Even though that cleared up with the help of PT, I decided I needed to try a trackball mouse for future computer activity and instantly fell in love with my new Logitech TrackMan Wheel mouse.  I've never been interested in going back to a standard mouse even though my shoulder has long since healed.After several years, though, that first Logitech trackball began having problems.  It seemed I was perpetually having to remove the ball for cleaning.  Although I never saw the 'crumbs' that must have become lodged, I sure felt them, as the ball movement would become jerky until I'd cleaned both the ball and the 'holder'.  Even though the difference was slight, it felt like I was driving over a boulder and was very annoying.Finally, I decided to spring for a new mouse of the same type and am very pleased with a couple of things.  First, the ball movement is so smooth and quick I'm very glad I decided to start anew.  The old ball had grown a bit sluggish even after cleaning, so I suppose the contact points were worn (and for good reason :).  I didn't realize that the movement felt a bit heavy until I had installed this new mouse, which is much quicker, lighter feeling and more responsive.  Secondly, since my desktop PC is several years old I have old connection ports.  The PC works fine and doesn't need to be replaced, but doesn't have any more USB ports available and almost all accessories now attach via USB port.  I am delighted that this mouse still provides the ability to install in PS2 mode via a supplied adapter.  Hurray.  That saves me having to buy a powered hub to add more USB ports.On the downside, the construction on this mouse is not as good as the previous model.  Although it looks identical but for being a slightly darker color, the wheel action on the new mouse is raspy rather than completely smooth as it was on the old model.  I can actually hear the wheel move and can feel resistance.  Although the ball is fine (even better than my old mouse) the wheel isn't as good.  I can only hope it will deliver smoother action with use.Still, I love this mouse.  It causes no fatigue in either my hand or arm even after hours of use whether gaming or doing extensive photo editing where I have more precise control than with a regular mouse.  I have arthritis in my thumbs, but have no pain whatsoever from using the ball and greatly appreciate that.  All in all, I find this the best ergonomic mouse and very reliable.  I highly recommend it even though the construction quality is not quite as high as my previous model.\",\n",

When I'm not watching movies and I'm playing my receiver for music I truly play it very very loud and the Onkyo M-282 seemed to be a good bit louder then my receiver.  It will get hot but not more then a receiver after using it for a while and I find the Onkyo to be a superb buy.  The price is right and the specs are real and are not over-rated like quite a bit of manufacturers these days.  The specs with Onkyo are either exact or a little bit underrated in my opinion and for the price, this amplifier is such a great deal.

I was able to create a waypoint, walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint (with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website)! As long as you keep moving, the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen, plenty of options and quite accurate. When used in your car, it tracks your speed to .1 mph, with updates given each second.  If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover, this is a nice addition. I suspect on an open lake, this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots.\",\n",

    "Topic modeling is the analysis of determining the key topics or themes in a corpus. With respect to machine learning, topic modeling is an unsupervised technique. One way to uncover the main topics in a corpus is to use [non-negative matrix factorization](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html). For this question, use non-negative matrix factorization to determine the top ten words for the first twenty topics. You should submit your answer as a list of lists. What topics exist in the reviews?"
